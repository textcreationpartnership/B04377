            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>AN ACCOUNT Of the following BOOK <hi>To all ſorts of Readers.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Book that is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented yea, is a Tranſlation from the <hi>Italian</hi> Copy, Printed at <hi>Venice</hi> in 1685. The firſt Man that got it, with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, out of the Authour's hands, and then had it Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> in 1675, with all the ſolemnity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations, was Fryer <hi>John</hi> of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſtiles himſelf Provincial; and he ſpeaks very fine things of it, and he had ſo heartily read it over, that
<pb facs="tcp:179937:6"/>the impreſſion which it made in his Mind, gave him the exact cue and knack of that ſort of Language which the Authour uſes, when he throws himſelf headlong into darkneſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity: And when this Man had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the Book to the ſincere Reader, after his way; the next that appears to give a Grace to it, is no leſs a Man, than the moſt Illuſtrious and moſt Reverend Lord, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> who tells us how many great Offices in the Church he had paſs'd through; he ſays in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Book, that 'tis a hard matter to make a judgement of it, without ſome experience of the things contained in it: And that how high ſoever the ſecret of it be above all humane Diſcourſe, yet they are not only not contrary to the right dictates of Reaſon, but altogether conformable to it: Which is as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Preface to ſome things in the Book, as any man in the World
<pb facs="tcp:179937:6"/>could have made with the Study of Seven Years: Firſt, to ſay that theſe ſoveraign Secrets, which the Book treats of, are above all humane Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe; and then in the very next words, to ſay they are conformable altogether to the dictates of Reaſon: as if the dictates of Reaſon and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Diſcourſe had entered into a Combination never to come to a right underſtanding of one another. He that would be further ſatisfied of the fitneſs of this Archbiſhop's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to the Book, will be gratified, by reading patiently ſome things of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Third Book: But 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that this great Man ſpeaks well of his Countryman <hi>Molinos</hi>'s Doctrine, that 'tis according to the judgment of the holy Fathers, and the uſual way of Myſtical Divines: he ſays again, that the Authour of this Book, does not ſpeak his own Capricios, but follows the footſteps
<pb facs="tcp:179937:7"/>of the Ancients, and builds upon their Principles, and ſpiritual Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that he reduces 'em to a right and clear Method, bringing forth (ſays he) out of his Treaſures, things new and old: And for the Stile of the Book, he allows it to be clear, eaſie, plain, and full in ſuch crabbed hard and lofty Subject; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, that the Man doth not decline Proofs of Scripture, Doctrines of the Fathers, Decrees of Councils, nor the Principles of Morality, and therefore he judges it to be a uſeful Piece, and very worthy to be Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and what can be ſaid more to ſet any Book off.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Archbiſhop's Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in comes that of Fryer <hi>Francis Mary,</hi> Miniſter General of the whole <hi>Franciſcian</hi> Order, given from his Convent of <hi>Ara Coeli,</hi> who ſpeaks mighty kindly and favourably of the Book, and recommends it to the Preſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:179937:7"/>Then appears the Approbation of Fryer <hi>Dominic</hi> of the moſt holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Qualifier and Counſellour of the holy Office of <hi>Malta,</hi> and of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> Rector of the Colledge of <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> at St. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crace,</hi> and he bleſſes himſelf as he ſits in judgment upon it, and gives his ſenſe and liking, as formally as the reſt.</p>
                  <p>After this comes a famous <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> another Qualifier of the <hi>Roman Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> and he takes it to be a Book of ſingular eſteem and uſe, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to others with as much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial kindneſs, as he fancied he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good by it.</p>
                  <p>And next to him a great <hi>Capucine,</hi> that could not forbear (either for the credit of the Book, or himſelf) to tell the World, that he had been no leſs than four ſeveral times, Provincial of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and was at preſent Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor General of all his Order; and expreſſes himſelf much taken with
<pb facs="tcp:179937:8"/>the Book, and as a good proof of ſo being, diſcourſes upon it in that Myſtical Way, and would by no means have it kept from being Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
                  <p>All this is <hi>Roman</hi> Approbation; which ſignifies but little to a Book that muſt be Printed in <hi>Venice;</hi> and therefore the Reformers of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Padua,</hi> who Licenſe Books, receiving a Certificate from their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, that the Book had nothing in it againſt Princes, or good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, give leave to a Stationer of <hi>Venice</hi> to Print it again there, in 1676, upon the Authority of which Licenſe it came out once more, in 1685; which was the Copy, that this Tranſlation goes by. So that this Book, it ſeems, has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſperſed in the World, by all theſe Impreſſions: And who can ſay any thing more for it, than ſuch men as theſe, that have Read and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd it ſo Candidly, and Kindly?
<pb facs="tcp:179937:8"/>If what has ſince happened to the Authour and his Reputation, do make his Vouchers wiſh that they had not been ſo free of their Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, let them look to that: But whil'ſt the poor Man is ſo harraſſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> it would become the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this religious Nation, to hear him ſpeak his Mind by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: What has ſtung the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> may be partly gueſſed at by this Book: Till we know further of the Authour, there is no more to be ſaid of him than that ſometimes he lights upon ſhrew'd Truths, and very excellent Thoughts, as well as meer Traſh and Foppery. Do but pardon him his rich Vein of Enthuſiaſm and Gibberiſh, and give him leave now and then to ſpeak further than you can ſee or apprehend, and you will find things enough to make you think and attend to what he ſays: But withal let me tell you, that 'tis a Bleſſing to you to live in a
<pb facs="tcp:179937:9"/>Country, where the Miniſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion do not uſe to put Tricks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Underſtanding nor lead you blindly you know not whither. And ſo I reſt,</p>

<pb facs="tcp:179937:10"/>become of this little Book then, which hath no Patronage? the Subject whereof being myſtical and not well-ſeaſoned, carries along with it the common cenſure, and will ſeem inſipid? Kind Reader, if you underſtand it not, be not therefore apt to cenſure the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Natural Man may hear and read theſe Spiritual Matters, but he can never compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. ch. 2.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Natural Man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the things of the Spirit of God.</hi> If you condemn it, you condemn your ſelf to the number of the wiſe men of this World, of whom St. <hi>Denis</hi> ſays, that God imparts not this Wiſdom to them, as he does to the ſimple and humble, though in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of men they be ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Myſtical knowledge proceeds not from Wit, but from Experience; it is not invented, but proved; not read, but received; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt ſecure, and efficacious, of great help and plentiful in fruit;
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> it enters not into the Soul by the Ears, nor by the continual Reading of Books, but by the free Infuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe Grace with moſt delightful intimacy, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the ſimple and lowly.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Learned Men who have never read theſe Matters, and ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb facs="tcp:179937:10"/>Men that hitherto have hardly reliſhed them, and therefore both condemn them, the one out of Ignorance, and the other for want of Experience.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is certain, that he who hath not the experience of this ſweetneſs, cannot paſs a Judgment upon theſe Myſterious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; nay, rather he'll be ſcandalized (as many are) when he hears of the Wonders which the Divine Love is wont to work in Souls, becauſe he finds no ſuch rarities in his own. Who ſhall limit the goodneſs of God, whoſe Arm is not ſhortened, but that he can do now what he hath wrought at other times? God calls neither the ſtrongest nor the richest for their merit; but calls rather the weakest and most wretched, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy may ſhine forth the more.</p>
                  <p>This Science is not Theoretical, but Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, wherein Experience ſurpaſſes the most refined and ingenious Speculation. Hence it was that St. <hi>Tereſia</hi> admoniſhed her ghoſtly Father, that he ſhould not confer about Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Matters, but with Spiritual Men; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if they know but one way, or if they have ſtopt mid-way, there is no ſucceſs to be expected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will ſoon appear that he hath no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this practical and myſtical Science,
<pb facs="tcp:179937:11"/>who ſhall condemn the Doctrine of this Book, and who hath not read St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> and many other Saints and Doctors approved by the Church, who like expert men, approve, commend and teach the Practice of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>It is to be taken notice of, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this Book inſtructs not all ſorts of Perſons, but thoſe only who have the Senſes and Paſſions well mortified, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready advanced and made progreſs in Prayer, and are called by God to the inward way, who encourages and guides them, freeing them from the obſtacles which hinder the courſe to perfect Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>I have taken care to have the Style of this Book devote, chast, and uſeful, without the ornament of polite Sentences, oſtentation of Eloquence, or Theological niceties, my only ſcope was to teach the Naked Truth, with humility, ſincerity, and perſpicuity.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be wondered at that new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Books are every day publiſhed in the World, becauſe God hath always new Lights to communicate, and Souls ſtand always in need of theſe Inſtructions. All things have not been ſaid, nor every thing written, hence it is that there will be Writing to the end of
<pb facs="tcp:179937:11"/>the World. Wonderful were the Lights that God Almighty communicated to his Church, by means of the Angelical Doctor St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and at the hour of his death, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid, that the Divine Majeſty had at that inſtant communicated to him ſo much light, that all he had before written came ſhort of it. God has, then, and always will have new Lights to communicate, without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his own Infinite Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>The many and grievous pains and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the inward way ought not to make a Soul deſpond, becauſe it is but reaſonable that a thing of great value ſhould coſt dear. Be of good comfort, and believe, that not only thoſe which are here repreſented, but many others alſo will be overcome with the Grace of God and Internal Fortitude.</p>
                  <p>It was never my deſign to treat of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, nor in defence of it, as many have done who have learnedly and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively publiſhed whole Books, full of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reaſons, Doctrines and Authorities of Saints and of the Holy Scripture, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the Opinion of thoſe who without any ground have condemned, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:179937:12"/>The Experience of many Years (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the many Souls who have truſted to my inſufficiency, for their conduct in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward way, to which they have been called) hath convinced me of the great neceſſity they are in of having the obſtacles taken out of their way, the inclinations, affections and allurements removed, which wholly hinder the courſe and obſtruct the way to perfect Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>This whole practical Book tends chiefly to this end, becauſe it is not enough to aſcertain the inward way of Contemplation, if the obſtacles be not taken out of the way of thoſe Souls that are called and aſſured, which hinder their progreſs and ſpiritual flight; For which end I have made uſe rather of what God out of his infinite mercy hath inſpired into me and taught me, than of any thing that the ſpeculative reading of Books has ſuggeſted unto me, or furniſhed me with.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes (though very ſeldom) I quote the Authority of ſome practical and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Author, to ſhew that the Doctrine which is here taught is not ſingular and rare. It hath been my first ſcope then, not to aſcertain the inward way, but to diſentangle and unpeſter it; My next hath been to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Spiritual Divertors, that they may
<pb facs="tcp:179937:12"/>not ſtop thoſe Souls in their courſe which are called by theſe ſecret Paths to internal Peace and ſupreme Felicity. God of his infinite mercy grant, that an end ſo much deſired may be obtained.</p>
                  <p>I hope in God, that ſome of thoſe Souls, whom his Divine Majeſty calls to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will find profit from what I have writ; for whoſe ſake I ſhall reckon my pains very well employed. This has been the only but of my deſire, and if God (as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will) accept and approve thoſe pure deſires, I ſhall be content and have my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <head>Firſt Advertiſement. <hi>By two ways one may go to God; the first by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Diſcourſe or Reaſoning; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by pure Faith and Contemplation.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THere are two ways of going to God, the one by Conſideration and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſcourſe, and the other by the Purity of Faith, an indiſtinct, general and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed knowledge. The firſt is called Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſecond Internal Recollection, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd Contemplation. The firſt is of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the ſecond of Proficients. The firſt is ſenſible, and material, the ſecond more naked, pure, and internal.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Soul is already accuſtomed to diſcourſe of Myſteries, by the help of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the uſe of corporal Images; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried from Creature to Cteature, and from Knowledge to Knowledge (though with very little of that which it wants) and from
<pb facs="tcp:179937:13"/>theſe to the Creator; Then God is wont to take that Soul by the hand, (if rather he calls it not in the very beginnings, and leads it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ratiocination by the way of pure Faith) making the intellect paſs by all conſiderations and reaſonings, draws it forward, and raiſes it out of this material and ſenſible ſtate, making it under a ſimple and obſcure knowledge of Faith, wholly aſpire to its Bridegroom upon the wings of Love, without any farther neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the perſwaſions and informations of the Intellect, to make it love him, becauſe in that manner the Soul's love would be very ſcanty, much dependent on Creatures, ſtinted to drops, and theſe too but falling with pauſes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By how much leſs it depends on Creatures, and the more it relies on God alone, and his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret documents, by the mediation of pure Faith, the more durable, firm, and ſtrong will that Love be. After the Soul hath already acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the knowledge which all the meditations and corporal images of Creatures can give her; if, now, the Lord raiſe her out of that ſtate, by ſtripping her of ratiocination, and leaving her in divine darkneſs, to the end ſhe may march in the ſtreight Way, and by pure Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>et her be guided, and not love with the ſcanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tenuity that theſe direct; but let her ſuppoſe that the whole World, and all that the moſt refined conceptions of the wiſeſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings can tell her, are nothing, and that the goodneſs and beauty of her beloved, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:179937:14"/>ſurpaſſes all their knowledge, being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all Creatures are too rude to inform her, and to conduct her to the true knowledge of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. She ought then to advance forward with her love, leaving all her underſtanding behind. Let her love God as he is in himſelf, and not as her imagination ſays he is, and frames him to her; And if ſhe cannot know him as he is in himſelf, let her love him without knowing him under the obſcure veils of Faith; in the ſame manner as a Son who hath never ſeen his Father, but fully believing thoſe who have given him information of him, loves him, as if he had already ſeen him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Soul, from which Mental Diſcourſe is taken, ought not to ſtrain her ſelf, nor ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly ſeek for more clear and particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but even without the ſupports of ſenſible conſolations or notices, with poverty of ſpirit, and deprived of all that the natural appetite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; continue quiet, firm and conſtant, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lord work his work, though ſhe may ſeem to be alone, exhauſted and full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and though this appear to her to be idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is only of her own ſenſible and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial activity, not of God's, who is working true knowledge in her.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Finally, the more the Spirit aſcends, the more it is taken off of ſenſible objects. Many are the ſouls, who have arrived and do arrive at this gate, but few have paſſed or do paſs it for want of the experimental guide, and thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:179937:14"/>who have had, and actually have it, for want of a true ſubjection and entire ſubmiſſion.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They'll ſay, that the Will will not love, but be unactive, if the Intellect underſtand not clearly and diſtinctly, it being a received Maxim, that that which is not known, cannot be loved. To this it is anſwered, that tho' the Intellect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not diſtinctly by ratiocination, Images and Conſiderations, yet it underſtands and knows by an obſcure; general, and confuſed Faith; which knowledge, tho' ſo obſcure, indiſtinct, and general, as being ſupernatural, hath nevertheleſs a more clear and perfect cognition of God, than any ſenſible and particular notice, that can be formed in this life, becauſe all corporal and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible repreſentation is infinitely diſtant from God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. We know God more perfectly (ſays St. <hi>Denis</hi>) by Negatives,

We think more highly of God, by knowing, that he is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, and above all our capacity, than by conceiving him under any image, or created beauty, according to our rude underſtanding. A greater eſteem and love then, will flow from this confuſed, obſcure and negative, than from any other ſenſible and diſtinct way; becauſe that is more proper to God and abſtracted from creatures; and this, on the contrary, the more it depends on creatures, the leſs it hath of God.</p>

This friendly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Soul hath with God, that's to ſay, in Prayer, is divided into Meditation and Contemplation.</p>

                     <p n="13">13. As often as the end is obtained, the means ceaſe, and when the Ship arrives in the Harbour the Voyage is over. So if the Soul after it hath been toyled and wearied by means of meditation, arrives at the ſtilneſs, tranquillity, and reſt of Contemplation, it ought then to cut off all reaſonings, and reſt quiet with an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="tcp:179937:16"/>attention, and ſimple Viſion of God; ſeeing and loving him, ſweetly rejecting all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations that preſent themſelves, calming the Mind in that Divine Preſence, recollecting the Memory, and fixing it wholly on God, being contented with a general and confuſed Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is had by the Mediation of Faith, applying the whole Will to love him, wherein conſiſts all their fruit of enjoyment.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. St. <hi>Denis</hi> ſays, <hi>As for you, most dear</hi> Timothy,

                        <hi>in applying your ſelf to Myſtical Speculations, abſtract from the Senſes, and Operations of the Intellect; from all ſenſible and intellegible Objects, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally from all things that are, and are not; and in an unknown and inexpreſſible Way, as much as lies in the power of Man, raiſe your ſelf to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of him, who is above all Nature, and Knowledge.</hi> Thus far the Saint.</p>
                     <p n="15">15.

                        <pb facs="tcp:179937:16"/>17. When the Soul attains to this ſtate, it ought wholly to retreat within it ſelf, in its own pure and profound Center; where the Image of God is, there is amorous attention, ſilence, the forgetfulneſs of all things, the application of the Will, with perfect reſignation, hearing and talking with God hand to hand, and in ſuch manner, as if there was no other but them two in the World.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Good reaſon have the Saints to ſay, that Meditation operates with toyl, and with fruit; Contemplation without toyl, with quiet, reſt, peace, delight, and far greater fruit. Meditation ſows, and Contemplation reaps: Meditation ſeeks, and Contemplation finds: Meditation chews the Food, Contemplation taſts and feeds on it.</p>

                     <p n="21">21. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> recommends this Active Contemplation, diſcourſing upon theſe Words, <hi>Audiam quid Loquatur in me Deus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm 85.</note> And he ſays, <hi>Optimam partem elegit Maria, licet non minoris (fortaſſe) meriti ſit apud deum humilis converſatio Marthae, ſed de electione Maria laudatur: quoniam illa omnio (quo ad nos ſpectat) eligenda, haec vero ſi injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur patienter est toleranda.</hi>

<note place="margin">Secunda q. 182 art 2. and 3.</note> In like manner St. <hi>Thomas</hi> inculcates this acquired Contern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation in the following Words; <hi>Quanto homo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimam ſuam, vel alterius propinquius deo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jungit,
<pb facs="tcp:179937:17"/>tanto ſacrificium est deo magis acceptum, unde magis acceptum est deo quod aliquis animam ſuam, &amp; aliorum applicet contemplationi quam actioni.</hi> Very clear Words to ſtop the Mouth of thoſe who condemn acquired Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. How much the nearer a man approaches his own Soul, or the Soul of another to God, ſo much the more acceptable is the Sacrifice to God; from whence it is inferred, (concludes the ſame Saint) that the application of a man's own Soul, or the procuring that of anothers to Contemplation, is more acceptable to God, than the applying of the ſame to Action. It cannot be ſaid, that the Saint ſpeaks here of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Contemplation, becauſe it is not in the power of man, to apply himſelf to the infuſed, but to the acquired.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Though it be ſaid, that we may with the Lord's help, ſet our ſelves to acquired Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; nevertheleſs, no man ought of his own Head to be ſo bold, as to paſs from the ſtate of Meditation to this, without the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of an expert Director, who ſhall clearly know whether his Soul be called by God to this inward way; or for want of a Director, the Soul it ſelf is to know it by ſome Book, that Treats of theſe Matters, ſent to him by Divine Providence, for diſcovering that, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing what it was, he experimentally felt within his own Heart. But though by means of the light which that Book gives him he may obtain aſſurance enough, to leave Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb facs="tcp:179937:18"/>for the quiet of Contemplation, yet his Soul will ſtill retain an ardent deſire of being more perfectly inſtructed.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. And to the end it may receive good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in order to that point, I'll here give it the Signs, whereby it ſhall know that Call to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. The firſt and chief is, an inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Meditate, and if the Soul meditate, it will perform it with much diſquiet and irkſomneſs, provided that proceed not from the indiſpoſition of Nature, or a melancholy Humour, or a Dryneſs, ſpringing from the want of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

It will be known not to be any of theſe defects, but rather a true Call, when that Soul paſſes a Day, a Month; any, and many Months, without being able to diſcourſe in Prayer. <hi>The Lord guides the Soul by Contemplation,</hi> (ſays the holy Mother <hi>Tereſa) and the Mind finds it ſelf much diſabled from Meditating the Paſſion of Christ, ſince Meditation is nothing elſe but a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God; the Soul once finding him, and retaining the Cuſtom of ſeeking him of new, by the operation of the Will, it will not be baffled with the Intellect.</hi> Thus far the Saint.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. The ſecond Sign is, that though it is wanting in ſenſible Devotion, yet it covets So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and avoids Converſation.</p>
                     <p>The third, that the reading of godly Books is uſually tedious to it, becauſe they ſpeak not of the Internal Sweetneſs, that is in its Heart, though it know it not.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, that though it find it ſelf deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>To the end God may rest in the Soul, the Heart is always to be kept peaceable in whatſoever Diſquiet, Temptation, and Tribulation.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THou art to know, that thy Soul is the Center, Habitation, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. That therefore, to the end the Sovereign King may reſt on that Throne of thy Soul, thou oughteſt to take pains to keep it clean, quiet, void, and peaceable; clean from guilt and defects; quiet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179937:20"/>from fears; void of affections, deſires, and thoughts; and peaceable in temptations and tribulations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thou oughteſt always then to keep thine Heart in peace, that thou mayeſt keep pure that Temple of God, and with a right and pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, thou art to work, pray, obey, and ſuffer, without being in the leaſt moved, whatever it pleaſes the Lord to ſend unto thee. Becauſe it is certain, that for the good of thy Soul, and for thy ſpiritual profit, he will ſuffer the envious enemy, to trouble that City of Reſt, and Throne of Peace, with temptations, ſuggeſtions, and tribulations, and by the means of creatures, with painful troubles, and grievous perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Be conſtant, and chear up thine heart in whatſoever diſquiet, theſe tribulations may cauſe to thee. Enter within it, that thou may'ſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, for therein is the Divine Fortreſs which defends, protects, and fights for thee. If a man hath a ſafe Fortreſs, he is not diſquieted, though his enemies purſue him, becauſe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating within it, theſe are diſappointed and overcome. The ſtrong Caſtle, that will make thee triumph over all thine enemies, viſible and inviſible, and over all their ſnares and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is within thine own Soul, becauſe in it reſides the Divine Aid and Sovereign Succour. Retreat within it, and all will be quiet, ſecure, peaceable, and calm.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It ought to be thy chief and continual exerciſe, to pacifie that Throne of thy Heart,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179937:20"/>that the Supreme King may reſt therein. The way to pacifie it, will be to enter into thy ſelf by means of internal recollection; all thy prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be Prayer, and a loving recollection in the Divine Preſence. When thou ſeeſt thy ſelf more ſharply aſſaulted, retreat into that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Peace, where thou'lt find the Fortreſs. When thou art more faint-hearted, betake thy ſelf to this refuge of Prayer, the only Armour for overcoming the enemy, and mitigating tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation: thou oughteſt not to be at a diſtance from it in a ſtorm, to the end thou mayeſt, as another <hi>Noah,</hi> experience tranquillity, ſecurity, and ſerenity, and to the end thy will may be reſigned, devote, peaceful, and courageous.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Finally, be not afflicted nor diſcouraged to ſee thy ſelf faint-hearted, he returns to quiet thee, that ſtill he may ſtir thee, becauſe this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Lord will be alone with thee, to reſt in thy Soul, and form therein a rich Throne of Peace; that within thine own heart, by means of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal recollection, and with his heavenly grace, thou may'ſt look for ſilence in tumult; ſolitude in company; light in darkneſs; forgetfulneſs in preſſures, vigour in deſpondency; courage in fear; reſiſtance in temptation; peace in war; and quiet in tribulation.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Though the Soul perceive it ſelf deprived of Diſcourſe, or Ratiocination, yet it ought to perſevere in Prayer, and not be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe that is its greater Felicity.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="6">6. THoul't find thy ſelf, as all other Souls that are called by the Lord, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward way, full of Confuſion and Doubts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Prayer thou haſt failed in Diſcourſe: It will ſeem to thee that God does no more aſſiſt thee as formerly, that the exerciſe of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not in thy power; that thou loſeſt time, whilſt hardly and with great trouble thou can'ſt make one ſingle Ejaculation as thou was wont to do.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. How much confuſion, and what perplexities will that want of enlarging thy ſelf in mental Diſcourſe raiſe in thee? And if in ſuch a juncture thou haſt not a ghoſtly Father, expert in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Way, thoul't certainly conclude that thy Soul is out of order, and that for the ſecurity of thy Conſcience, thou ſtandeſt in need of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Confeſſion; and all that will be got by that care, will be the ſhame and confuſion of both. O how many Souls are called to the inward way, and the Spiritual Fathers for want of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding their caſe, inſtead of guiding and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179937:21"/>helping them forwards, ſtop them in their Courſe, and ruin them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thou oughteſt then to be perſwaded, that thou mayeſt not draw back, when thou wanteſt expanſion and diſcourſe in Prayer; that it is thy greateſt happineſs, becauſe it is a clear ſign, that the Lord will have thee to walk by Faith and Silence in his Divine Preſence, which is the moſt profitable and eaſieſt Path; in reſpect, that with a ſimple view, or amorous attention to God, the Soul appears like a humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant before its Lord, or as an innocent Child, that caſts it ſelf into the ſweet and ſafe Boſom of its dear Mother. Thus did <hi>Gerſon</hi> expreſs it, <hi>Though I have ſpent Fourty Years in Reading and Prayer, yet I could never find any thing more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, nor compendious, for attaining to Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Theology, than that our Spirit ſhould become like a young Child and Beggar in the preſence of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. That kind of Prayer is not only the eaſieſt, but the moſt ſecure; becauſe it is abſtracted from the operations of the Imagination, that is always expoſed to the Tricks of the Devil, and the extravagancies of Melancholy, and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, wherein the Soul is eaſily Diſtracted, and being wrapt up in Speculation, reflects on it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When God had a mind to inſtruct his own Captain <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 24.</note> and give him the two Tables of the Law, written in Stone, he called him up to the Mountain, at what time God being there with him, the Mount
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179937:22"/>was Darkened and environed with thick Clouds <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtanding idle, not knowing what to think or ſay. Seven days after God commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> to come up to the Top of the Mountain, where he ſhow'd him his Glory, and filled him with great Conſolation.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. So in the Beginning, when God intends, after an extraordinary manner, to guide the Soul inter the School of the divine and loving Notices of the internal Law, he makes it go with Darkneſs, and Dryneſs, that he may bring it near to himſelf, becauſe the Divine Majeſtie knows very well, that it is not by the means of ones one Ratiocination, or Induſtry, that a Soul draws near to him, and underſtands the Divine Documents; but rather by ſilent and humble Reſignation.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Patriarch <hi>Noah</hi> gave a great inſtance of this; who after he had been by all men rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned a Fool, floating in the middle of a rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sea, wherewith the whole World was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed, without Sails and Oars, and environed with wild Beaſts, that were ſhut up in the Ark walked by Faith alone, not knowing nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what God had a mind to do with him.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. What moſt concerns thee, O redeemed Soul, is Patience, not to deſiſt from the Prayer thou art about, though thou can'ſt not enlarge is Diſcourſe. Walk with firm Faith, and a holy Silence, dying in thy ſelf, with all thy natura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179937:22"/>but thy good. It is clear that he who is a dying, muſt needs feel it, but how well is time employed, when the Soul is dead, dumb, and reſigned in the preſence of God, there without any clutter or diſtraction, to receive the Divine Influences.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Senſes are not capable of divine Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; hence if thou wouldſt be Happy and Wiſe; be Silent and Believe; Suffer and have Patience; be Confident and Walk on; it concerns thee far more to hold thy Peace, and to let thy ſelf be guided by the hand of God, than to enjoy all the Goods of this World. And though it ſeem to thee, that thou doſt nothing at all, and art idle being ſo Dumb and Reſigned; yet it is of infinite fruit.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Conſider the blinded Beaſt that turns the Wheel of the Mill, which though it ſee not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know what it does, yet does a great Work in grinding the Corn, and although it taſte not of it, yet its Maſter receives the fruit, and taſtes of the ſame. Who would not think, during ſo long a time that the Seed lies in the Earth, but that it were loſt? Yet afterwards it is ſeen to ſpring up, grow and multiply. God does the ſame with the Soul, when he deprives it of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Ratiocination: Whil'ſt it thinks it does nothing, and is, in a manner undone, in time it comes to it ſelf again, improved, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, and perfect, having never hoped for ſo much favour.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Take care then that thou afflict not thy ſelf, nor draw back, though thou can'ſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179937:23"/>thy ſelf, and diſcourſe in Prayer; ſuffer, hold thy peace, and appear in the preſence of God; perſevere conſtantly, and truſt to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Bounty, who can give unto thee conſtant Faith, true light, and divine Grace. Walk as if thou wert blindfolded, without thinking or reaſoning; put thy ſelf into his kind and pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hands, reſolving to do nothing but what his divine Will and Pleaſure is.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The Soul is not to afflict it ſelf, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Prayer, becauſe it ſees it ſelf encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with dryneſs.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="25">25. THou ſhalt know that there are two form of Prayer, the one tender, delightful, amiable, and full of ſentiments; the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, dry, deſolate, tempted, and darkſome. The firſt is of Beginners, the ſecond of Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who are in the progreſs to Perfection. God gives the firſt to gain Souls, the ſecond to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. With the firſt he uſes them like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; with the ſecond he begins to deal with them as with ſtrong men.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. This firſt Way may be called the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Life, and belongs to them who go in the tract of the ſenſible Devotion, which God uſes to give to Beginners, to the end that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with that ſmall reliſh, as the natura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> man is with the ſenſible Object, they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelves to the ſpiritual Life. The ſecond is called the Life of men, and belongs to thoſe who not minding ſenſible Pleaſures, fight and war againſt their own Paſſions, that they may conquer and obtain Perfection, the proper em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of men.</p>
                     <p n="27">
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:179937:25"/>27. Aſſure thy ſelf, that dryneſs or ardity is the Inſtrument of thy good, becauſe it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a want of ſenſibility, that Remora, which puts a ſtop to the flight of almoſt all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Men, and makes them even draw back, and leave off Prayer: as may be ſeen in many Souls, which only perſevere whil'ſt they taſte ſenſible Conſolation.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. Know that the Lord makes uſe of the Veil of Dryneſs, to the end we may not know what he is working in us and ſo be humble; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we felt and knew what he is working in our Souls, ſatisfaction and preſumption would get in, imagining that we were doing ſome good thing, and reckoning our ſelves very near to God; which would be our undoing.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. Lay this down as a firm ground in thine Heart, that for walking in the inward Way, all ſenſibilitie ſhould firſt be removed; and that the means God uſes for that is dryneſs. By that alſo he takes away reflection, or that view, whereby the Soul eyes what it is doing, the only impediment that obſtructs the advancing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and God's communicating himſelf, and operating in it.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Thou oughteſt not then to afflict thy ſelf, nor think that thou reapeſt no fruit, becauſe in coming from a Communion or Prayer, thou haſt not the experience of many ſentiments, ſince that is a manifeſt Cheat. The Husbandman Sows in one time and Reaps in another: So God, upon occaſions, and in his own due time,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179937:26"/>will help them to reſiſt Temptations, and when leaſt thou thinkeſt, will give thee holy purpoſes, and more effectual deſires of ſerving him. And to the end, thou mayeſt not ſuffer thy ſelf to be tranſported, by the violent ſuggeſtion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, who will enviouſly perſwade thee, that thou do'ſt nothing, and that thou loſeſt time, that ſo thou mayeſt neglect Prayer: I'll declare to thee ſome of the infinite fruits, that thy Soul reaps from that great dryneſs.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. The firſt is to perſevere in Prayer, from which fruit ſpring many other advantages.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Thou'lt find a loathing of the things of the World, which by little and little tends to the ſtifling of the bad deſires of thy paſt Life, and the producing of other new ones of ſerving God.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Thou'lt reflect upon many failings, on which formerly thou didſt not reflect.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Thou'lt find, when thou art about to commit any evil, an advertency in thy Heart, which reſtrains thee from the execution of it, and at other times from Speaking, Lamenting, or Revenging thy ſelf; that'll take thee off from ſome little earthly Pleaſure, or from this or t'other Occaſion, or Converſation, into which formerly thou was running in great Peace and Security, without the leaſt Check or Remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. After that through frailty, thou haſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in to ſome light fault, thou'lt feel a Reproof for it in thy Soul, which will exceedingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thee.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:179937:26"/>VI. Thoul't feel within thy ſelf, deſires of ſuffering, and of doing the will of God.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. An inclination to Virtue, and greater eaſe in overcoming thy ſelf, and conquering the difficulties of the Paſſions, and Enemies that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee in the way.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Thoul't know thy ſelf better, and be confounded alſo in thy ſelf, feel in thee a high eſteem of God above all created Beings, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Creatures, and a firm Reſolution not to abandon Prayer, though thou knoweſt that it will prove to thee a moſt cruel Martyrdom.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. Thou'lt be ſenſible of greater Peace in thy Soul, love to Humility, confidence in God, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and abſtraction from all Creatures; and finally the Sins thou haſt omitted ſince the time that thou exerciſed thy ſelf in Prayer, are ſo many ſigns, that the Lord is working in thy Soul, (though thou knoweſt it not) by means of dry Prayer; and although thou feeleſt it not whilſt thou art in Prayer, thou'lt feel it in his due time, when he ſhall think it fit.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. All theſe and many other fruits are like new Buds that ſpring from the Prayer, which thou would'ſt give over, becauſe it ſeems to thee to be dry, that thou ſeeſt no Fruit of it, nor reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt no advantage therefrom. Be conſtant and perſevere with Patience, for though thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it not, thy Soul is profited thereby.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Treating of the ſame thing, declaring how many ways of Devotion there are, and how the ſenſible Devotion is to be diſpoſed; and that the Soul is not idle, though it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not.</hi>

                     <p n="33">33. THere are to be found two ſorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; the one eſſential and true; the other accidental and ſenſible. The eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, is a promptitude of mind to do well,
<note n="(1)" place="margin">S. Thom. 2. 2. q 82. art. 1.</note> fulfil the commands of God, and to perform all things belonging to his ſervice, though, through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, all be not actually done as is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<note n="(2)" place="margin">Suar. t. 2. de Pel. l. 2. c. 6. n. 16. &amp; 18.</note> This is true Devotion, though it be not accompanied with pleaſure, ſweetneſs, delight, nor tears, but rather it is uſually attended with temptation, dryneſs, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Accidental and ſenſible Devotion is,
<note n="(3)" place="margin">St. Bern. Ser. I. de Nat. Dom. Suarez, ib. Molin. de Oration, c. 6.</note> when good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are attended with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſoftneſs of heart, tenderneſs of tears, or other ſenſible affections. This is not to be ſought after, nay, it is rather more ſecure to wean the will from it, and to ſet light by it;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179937:27"/>becauſe beſides that it is uſually dangerous, it is a great obſtacle to progreſs, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the internal way. And therefore we ought only to embrace the true and eſſential De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which is always in our power to come by, ſeeing every one doing his duty may with the aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace acquire it. And this may be had with God, with Chriſt, with the Myſteries, with the Virgin, and with the Saints.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. Some think that when Devotion and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Pleaſure are given them, they are Favours of God, that thence forward they have him, and that the whole life is to be ſpent in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after that delight; but it is a cheat, becauſe it is no more, but a conſolation of nature, and a pure reflexion, wherewith the Soul beholds what it does, and hinders the doing, or poſſibility of doing any thing, the acquiſition of the true light, and the making of one ſtep in the way of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The Soul is a pure Spirit and is not felt; and ſo the internal acts, and of the will, as being the acts of the Soul and ſpiritual, are not ſenſible: Hence the Soul knows not if it liveth, nor, for moſt part, is ſenſible if it acteth.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. From this thou mayeſt infer, that that Devotion and ſenſible Pleaſure, is not God, nor Spirit, but the product of Nature; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou oughteſt to ſet light by, and deſpiſe it, but firmly to perſevere in Prayer, leaving thy ſelf to the conduct of God, who will be to thee light in aridity and darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. Think not that when thou art dry and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179937:28"/>darkſom in the preſence of God, with faith and ſilence, that thou do'ſt nothing, that thou loſeſt time, and that thou art idle, becauſe not to wait on God, according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Barnard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tom. 5. in Tract. de vit. ſolit. c. 8. p. 90.</note> is the greateſt idleneſs: <hi>Otioſum non est vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Deo; inimo negotiorum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um hoc eſt;</hi> And elſewhere he ſayeth, that that idleneſs of the Soul is the buſineſs of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of God. <hi>Hoc negotium magnum est ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="38">38. It is not to be ſaid, that the Soul is idle; becauſe though it operate not <hi>Actively,</hi> yet the Holy Ghoſt operates in it. Beſides, that it is not without all activity, becauſe it operates, though ſpiritually, ſimply, and intimately. For to be attentive to God, draw near to him, to follow his internal inſpirations, receive his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influences, adore him in his own intimate center, reverence him with the pious affections of the will, to caſt away ſo many and ſo fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical imaginations, and with ſoftneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to overcome ſo many temptations: all theſe, I ſay, are true acts though ſimple, wholly ſpiritual, and in a manner imperceptible, through the great tranquillity, wherewith the Soul exerts them.</p>

                     <p n="39">39. THere are two ſorts of darkneſs: ſome unhappy, and others happy: the firſt are ſuch as ariſe from ſin, and are unhappy, becauſe they lead the Chriſtian to an eternal precipice. The ſecond are thoſe which the Lord ſuffers to be in the Soul, to ground and ſettle it in vertue; and theſe are happy, becauſe they enlighten it, fortifie it, and cauſe greater light therein, ſo that thou oughteſt not to grieve and diſturb thy ſelf, nor be diſconſolate in ſeeing thy ſelf obſcure and darkſom, judging that God hath failed thee, and the light alſo that thou formerly had the experience of; thou oughteſt rather at that time perſevere conſtantly in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it being a manifeſt ſign, that God of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy intends to bring thee into the inward path, and happy way of Paradiſe. O how happy wilt thou be, if thou embrace it with peace and reſignation, as the inſtrument of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect quiet, true light, and of all thy ſpiritual good.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. Know then that the ſtreighteſt, moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſecure way of proficients, is the way
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179937:29"/>of darkneſs: beauſe in them the Lord placed his own Throne; And <hi>he made darkneſs his ſecret place.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm 18.</note> By them the ſupernatural light, which God infuſes into the Soul, grows and increaſes. Amidſt them wiſdom and ſtrong love are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, by darkneſs the ſoul is annihilated, and the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which hinder the right view of the divine truth, are conſumed. By this means God introduces the Soul by the inward way into the Prayer of reſt, and of perfect contemplation, which ſo few have the experience of. Finally, by darkneſs the Lord purges the ſenſes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, which hinder the myſtical progreſs.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. See now if darkneſs be not to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and embraced. What thou oughteſt to do amidſt them, is to believe, that thou art before the Lord, and in his preſence; but thou oughteſt to do ſo, with a ſweet and quiet attention not deſire to know any thing, nor ſearch after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies, tenderneſſes, or ſenſible devotions, nor do any thing but what is the good will and pleaſure of God; Becauſe otherwiſe thou wilt only make circles, all thy life time, and not advance one ſtep towards perfection.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>To the end the Soul may attain to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme internal peace, it is neceſſary, that God purge it after his way, becauſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and mortifications that of it ſelf it ſets about, are not ſufficient.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="42">42. SO ſoon as thou ſhalt firmly reſolve to mortifie thy external ſenſes, that thou may'ſt advance towards the high mountain of perfection, and union with God; His divine Majeſty will ſet his hand to the purging of thy evil inclinations, inordinate deſires, vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, ſelf-love and pride, and other hidden vices, which thou knoweſt not, and yet reign in the inner parts of thy Soul, and hinder the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine union.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. Thou'lt never attain to this happy ſtate, though thou tire thy ſelf out with the external acts of mortification and reſignation, until this Lord purge thee inwardly, and diſcipline thee after his own way, becauſe he alone knows how ſecret faults are to be purged out. If thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere conſtantly, he'll not only purge thee from affections and engagements to natural and temporal goods, but in his own time alſo he will purifie thee with the ſupernatural and ſublime, ſuch as are internal communications, inward
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179937:30"/>raptures and extafies, and other infuſed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, on which the Soul reſts and enjoys it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. God will do all this in thy Soul by means of the croſs, and dryneſs, if thou freely giveſt thy conſent to it by reſignation, and walking through thoſe darkſom and deſart ways. All thou haſt to do, is to do nothing by thy own choice alone. The ſubjection of thy liberty, is that which thou oughteſt to do, quietly reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf up in every thing whereby the Lord ſhall think fit internally and externally to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thee: becauſe that is the only means, by which thy Soul can become capable of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influences, whil'ſt thou ſuffereſt internal and external tribulation, with humility, patience and quiet; not the penances, diſciplines and mortifications, which thou couldeſt impoſe upon thy ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. The husbandman ſets a greater eſteem upon the plants which he ſows in the ground, than thoſe that ſpring up of themſelves, becauſe theſe never come to ſeaſonable maturity. In the ſame manner God eſteems and is better pleaſed with the vertue, which he ſows and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes into the Soul (as being ſunk into its own nothingneſs, calm and quiet, retreated within its own center, and without any election) than all the other vertues which the Soul pretends to acquire by its own election and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. It concerns thee only then, to prepare thine heart, like clean paper, wherein the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179937:30"/>wiſdom may imprint characters to his own liking. O how great a work will it be for thy Soul to be whole hours together in Prayer, dumb, reſigned, and humble, without acting, knowing, or deſiring to underſtand any thing.</p>

                     <p n="47">47. WIth new efforts thoul't exerciſe thy ſelf, but in another manner than hitherto, giving thy conſent to receive the ſecret and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operations, and to be poliſhed, and purified by this Lord, which is the only means whereby thou wilt become clean and purged from thine ignorance and diſſolutions. Know, however, that thou art to be plunged in a bitter ſea of ſorrows, and of internal and external pains, which torment will pierce into the moſt inward part of thy Soul and Body.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. Thou'lt experience, that the creatures will forſake thee, nay, thoſe too from which thou hoped'ſt for moſt favour and compaſſion in thy ſtreights; the brooks of thy faculties will be ſo dried up, that thou ſhalt'ſt not be able to form any ratiocination, nay, nor ſo much as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a good thought of God. Heaven will ſeem to thee to be of braſs, and thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no light from it. Nor will the thought

                     <p n="49">49. The inviſible enemies will purſue thee with ſcruples, laſcivious ſuggeſtions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thoughts, with incentives to impatience, pride, rage, curſing and blaſpheming the Name of God, his Sacraments, and Holy Myſteries. Thou'lt find a great lukewarmneſs, loathing, and weariſomneſs for the things of God; an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and darkneſs in thy underſtanding; a faintneſs, confuſion and narrowneſs of heart; ſuch a coldneſs and feebleneſs of the will to reſiſt, that a ſtraw will appear to thee a beam. Thy deſertion will be ſo great, that thou'lt think there is no more a God for thee, and that thou art rendered incapable of entertaining a good deſire; ſo that thou'lt continue ſhut up betwixt two walls, in conſtant ſtreights and anguiſh, without any hopes of ever getting out of ſo dreadful an oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. But fear not: all this is neceſſary for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thy Soul, and making it know its own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſenſibly perceive the annihilation of all the paſſions, and diſordinate appetites, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it rejoyced it ſelf. Finally, to the end the Lord may refine and purifie thee after his own manner with thoſe inward torments, wilt thou not caſt the <hi>Jonas</hi> of ſenſe into the ſea, that thereby thou mayeſt procure it? With all thy outward diſciplines and mortifications, thou'll never have true light, nor make one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection: ſo that thou wilt ſtop in the

                     <p n="51">51. OUr own nature is ſo baſe, proud and ambitious, and ſo full of its own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, its own judgment and opinions, that if temptations reſtrained it not, it would be undone without remedy. The Lord then ſeeing our miſery and perverſe inclination, and thereby moved to compaſſion, ſuffers us to be aſſaulted by divers thoughts againſt the faith, horrible temptations, and by violent and painful ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of impatience, pride, gluttony, luxury, rage, blaſphemy, curſing, deſpair, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of others, to the end we may know our ſelves and be humble.

That thou mayeſt not loſe internal peace, it is neceſſary thou believe, that it is the goodneſs of divine mercy, when thus it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, afflicts and trys thee; ſince by that means thy Soul comes to have a deep knowledge of it ſelf, reckoning it ſelf the worſt, moſt impious and abominable of all Souls living, and hence with humility and lowlineſs it abhors it ſelf. O how happy would Souls be, if they would be quiet and believe, that all theſe temptations are cauſed by the Devil, and received from the hand of God, for their gain and ſpiritual profit.</p>

But thou'll ſay, that it is not the work of the Devil, when he moleſts thee by means of creatures, but the effect of thy neighbours fault and malice, in having wronged and injured thee. Know that that is another cunning and hidden temptation, becauſe though God wills not the ſin of another, yet he wills his own ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in thee, and the trouble which accrues to thee from another's fault, that he may ſee thee emproved by the benefit of patience.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. Doeſt thou receive an injury from any man: there are two things in it, the ſin of him that does it, and the puniſhment that thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt; the ſin is againſt the will of God, and diſpleaſes him, though he permit it; the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is conform to his will, and he wills it for thy good, wherefore thou oughteſt to receive it, as from his hand. The Paſſion and Death of our Lord Chriſt, were the effects of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſins of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and yet it is certain, that God willed the death of his own Son for our redemption.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. Conſider how the Lord makes uſe of another's fault for the good of thy Soul. O the greatneſs of the Divine Wiſdom, who can pry into the depth of the ſecret and extraordinary means, and the hidden paths whereby he guides the Soul, which he would have purged, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and deified.</p>

                     <p n="59">59. THat the Soul may be the habitation of the celeſtial King, it is neceſſary, that it ſhould be pure, and without any blemiſh; wherefore the Lord purifies it as gold in the furnace of terrible and grievous temptations. Certain it is, that the Soul never loves, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves more, than when it is afflicted and baited with ſuch temptations; becauſe thoſe doubtings and fears that beſet it, whether it believe or not; whether it conſent or not, are nothing elſe but the quaintneſſes of love.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. The effects that remain in the Soul make this very clear; and commonly theſe are a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelf with a moſt profound acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greatneſs and omnipotence of God, a great confidence in the Lord, that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it from all risk and danger; believing and confeſſing with far greater vigour of faith, that it is God who gives it ſtrength to bear the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe temptations, becauſe it would naturally be impoſſible, conſidering the force and violence wherewith ſometimes they attack, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt one quarter of an hour.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. Thou art to know then, that temptation is thy great happineſs; ſo that the more it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets thee, the more thou oughteſt to rejoyce in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179937:33"/>Peace, inſtead of being ſad, and thank God for the favour he does thee. In all theſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and odious thoughts, the remedy that is to work, is to deſpiſe them with a ſtayed neglect, becauſe nothing more afflicts the proud devil, than to ſee that he is ſlighted and deſpiſed, as are all things elſe that he ſuggeſts to us. And therefore thou art to tarry with him, as one that perceives him not, and to poſſeſs thy ſelf in thy peace without repining, and without multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons and Anſwers; ſeeing nothing is more dangerous, than to vie in reaſons with him who is ready to deceive thee.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. The Saints in arriving at holineſs, paſſed through this doleful valley of temptations, and the greater Saints they were, the greater tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they grapled with. Nay after the Saints have attained to holineſs and perfection; the Lord ſuffers them to be tempted with brisk temptations, that their Crown may be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the ſpirit of vain-glory may be checked, or elſe hindred from entring in them, keeping them in that manner ſecure, humble, and ſollicitous of their condition.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. Finally thou art to know, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Temptation is to be without Temptation; wherefore thou oughteſt to be glad when it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults thee, and with Reſignation, Peace and Conſtancy reſiſt it: Becauſe if thou wilt ſerve God, and arrive at the ſublime Region of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Peace; thou muſt paſs through that rugged Path of Temptation; put on that heavy Armor; fight in that fierce and cruel War, and in that

                     </head>
                     <p n="64">64. INternal Recollection is Faith, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Preſence of God. Hence thou oughteſt to be accuſtomed to recollect thy ſelf in his Preſence, with an affectionate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as one that is given up to God, and united unto him, with Reverence, Humility and Submiſſion, beholding him in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receſs of thine own Soul, without Form, Likeneſs, Manner, or Figure; in the view and general nature of a loving and obſcure Faith, without any diſtinction of Perfection or Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. There thou art to be with attention, and a ſincere regard, with a ſedate heedfulneſs, and full of Love towards the ſame Lord, reſigning and delivering thy ſelf up into his hands, to the end he may diſpoſe of thee, according to his good Will and Pleaſure; without reflecting on thy ſelf; nay, nor on Perfection it ſelf. Here
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179937:34"/>thou art to ſhut up the Senſes, truſting God with all the care of thy Welfare, and minding nothing of the affairs of this Life. Finally, thy Faith ought to be pure, without Repreſentations or Likeneſs: Simple without Reaſonings, and Univerſal without Diſtinctions.</p>
                     <p n="66">66. The Prayer of Internal Recollection may be well typified by that Wreſtling, which the holy Scripture ſays, the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> had all Night with God, until Day broke, and he Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. Wherefore the Soul is to perſevere, and wreſtle with the difficulties that it will find in internal Recollection, without deſiſting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Son of internal Light begin to appear, and the Lord give it his Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p n="67">67. No ſooner wilt thou have given thy ſelf up to thy Lord in this inward Way, but all Hell will conſpire againſt thee, ſeeing one ſingle Soul inwardly retired to its own Preſence, makes greater War againſt the Enemy, than a thouſand others that walk externally; becauſe the Devil makes an infinite advantage of an internal Soul.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. In the time of the recollection, Peace and Reſignation of thy Soul, God will more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the various impertinent, troubleſome and ugly thoughts that thou haſt; than the good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and high ſentiments. Know that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which thou thy ſelf mayeſt make to reſiſt Thoughts, is an impediment, and will leave thy Soul in greater anxitie. The beſt thing that is to be done, is ſweetly to deſpiſe them, to know thine own wretchedneſs, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179937:35"/>make an Offering to God of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. Though thou canſt not get rid off the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Thoughts, haſt no Light, Comfort, nor ſpiritual Sentiment: Yet be not afflicted, neither leave off recollection, becauſe they are the Snares of the Enemy: Reſign thy ſelf at that time with Vigour endure with Patience, and perſevere in his Preſence; for whil'ſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevereſt after that manner, thy Soul will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally emproved.</p>
                     <p n="70">70. Doeſt thou believe that when thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt away from Prayer dry, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as thou began it; that that was becauſe of want of Preparation, and that hath done thee no good: That is a Fallacy: Becauſe the fruit of true Prayer, conſiſts not in enjoying the Light, nor in having Knowledge of ſpiritual things, ſince theſe may be found in a ſpeculative Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, without true Virtue and Perfection; it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſts in enduring with Patience, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in Faith and Silence, believing that thou art in the Lord's Preſence, turning to him thy Heart with tranquillity, and purity of Mind. So whil'ſt thou perſevereſt in this manner, thou'lt have the only Preparation and Diſpoſition which at that time is neceſſary, and ſhalt reap infinite fruit.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. War is very uſual in this internal Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which on the one hand will deprive thee of ſenſibility, to try, humble, and purge thee. On the other, inviſible Enemies will aſſault thee with continual Suggeſtions, to trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179937:35"/>thee. Nature her ſelf, apparently, will torment thee, ſhe being always an Enemy to the Spirit, which in depriving her of ſenſible Pleaſures, remains Weak, Melancholy, and full of Irkſomneſs, ſo that it feels a Hell in all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exerciſes, particularly in that of Prayer, hence it grows extreamly impatient to be at an end of it, through the uneaſineſs of Thoughts, the laſſitude of Body, importunate Sleep, and the not being able to curb the Senſes, every one of which would for its own ſhare, follow its own Pleaſure. Happy art thou if thou canſt perſevere amidſt this Martyrdom!</p>
                     <p n="74">74. That great Doctoreſs, and Myſtical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, <hi>Santa Tereſa,</hi> confirms all this by her heavenly Doctrine, in the Letter ſhe wrote to the Biſhop of <hi>Oſmia,</hi> to inſtruct him, how he was to behave himſelf in Prayer, and in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of troubleſome Thoughts, which attack us at that time, where ſhe ſays:
<note place="margin">8. of her Epiſtolary.</note> 
                        <hi>There is a neceſſity of ſuffering the trouble of a Troop of Thoughts, importune Imaginations, and the impetuoſities of natural Notions, not only, of the Soul through the dryneſs and diſunion it hath, but of the Body alſo, occaſioned by the want of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Spirit, which it ought to have.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="73">73. Theſe are called dryneſſes in Spirituals, but are very profitable, if they be embraced and ſuffered with Patience. Who ſo ſhall accuſtom himſelf to ſuffer them without repining, will from that Labour draw vaſt advantage, It is certain, that in recollection the Devil frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charges the Soul more fiercely with a Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179937:36"/>of Thoughts, to diſcomfit the quiet of the Soul, and alienate it from that moſt ſweet and ſecure internal Converſation, raiſing horrours, to the end it may leave it off, reducing it moſt commonly to ſuch a ſtate, as if it were led forth to a moſt rigorous Torment.</p>
                     <p n="74">74. <hi>The Birds, which are the Devils, knowing this</hi> (ſaid the Saint in the above-cited Letter) <hi>pricks and moleſt the Soul with Imaginations, troubleſome Thoughts, and the Interruptions which the Devil at that time brings in, tranſporting the Thought, diſtracting it from one thing to another, and after he hath done with them attacking the Heart, and it is no ſmall fruit of Prayer, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer theſe Troubles and Importunities. That is an offering up of ones ſelf, in a whole burnt Sacrifice, that's to ſay, to be wholly conſumed in the Fire of Temptation, and no part ſpared.</hi> See, how this heavenly Miſtreſs encourages to ſuffer and endure Thoughts and Temptations; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, provided they be not conſented to, they double the profit.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. As many times as thou exerciſeſt thy ſelf, calmly to reject theſe vain Thoughts, ſo many Crowns will the Lord ſet upon thy Head, and and though it may ſeem to thee that thou do'ſt nothing, be undeceiv'd, for a good deſire with firmneſs and ſtedfaſtneſs in Prayer, is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. <hi>Wherefore to be there</hi> (concludes the Saint) <hi>without ſenſible profit, is not lost time; but of great gain, whil'st one toyls without Interest, and meerly for the Glory of God; and though it may
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179937:36"/>ſeem to be toyling in vain, yet it is not ſo, but it is as with Children, who toyl and labour under the power of their Father: though in the evening they receive not the wages for their day's work, yet at the year's end they enjoy all.</hi> In fine, you ſee how the Saint confirms our document with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctrine.</p>

                     <p n="77">77. GOD loves not him who does moſt, who hears moſt, nor who ſhows great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection, but who ſuffers moſt, if he pray with faith and reverence, believing that he is in the divine preſence. The truth is to take from the Soul the prayer of the ſenſes, and of nature, is a rigorous martyrdom to it, but the Lord rejoyces, and is glad in its peace, if it be thus quiet and reſigned. Uſe not at that time vocal prayer, becauſe however it be good and holy in it ſelf, yet to uſe it then is a manifeſt temptation, whereby the enemy pretends, that God ſpeaks not to thy heart, under pretext that thou haſt not ſentiments, and that thou loſeſt time.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. God hath no regard to the multitude of words, but to the purity of the intent. His greateſt content and glory at that time, is to ſee the Soul in ſilence deſirous, humble, quiet, and

                     <p n="79">79. How many have begun this happy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Prayer, and Internal Recollection, and have left it off, pretending that they feel no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> pleaſure, that they loſe time, that their thought trouble them, and that that Prayer is not for them, whil'ſt they find not any ſentiment of God, nor any ability to reaſon or diſcourſe; whereas they might have believed, been ſilent and had patience. All this is no more, but with ingratitude to hunt after ſenſible pleaſures, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themſelves to be tranſported with ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, ſeeking themſelves, and not God, becauſe they cannot ſuffer a little pain and dryneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting on the infinite loſs they ſuſtain, whereas by the leaſt act of reverence towards God, amidſt dryneſs and ſterility, they receive an eternal reward.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. The Lord told the venerable Mother <hi>Franceſca Lopez</hi> of <hi>Valenza,</hi> and a religious of the third Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> three things of great light and conſequence in order to internal recollection. <hi>In the first place, that a quarter of an hour of Prayer, with recollection of the ſenſes and faculties, and with reſignation and humility, does more good to the Soul than five days of penitential exerciſes, hair cloaths, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179937:37"/>faſtings, and ſleeping on bare boards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are only mortifications of the body, and with recollection the Soul is purified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="81">81. <hi>Secondly, that it is more pleaſing to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, to have the Soul in quiet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote Prayer for the ſpace of an hour, than to go in great Pilgrimages; becauſe that in Prayer it does good to it ſelf, and to thoſe for whom it prays, gives delight to God, and merits a high degree of glory, but in pilgrimage, commonly, the Soul is diſtracted, and the Senſes diverted, with a debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of vertue, beſides many other dangers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="82">82. <hi>Thirdly, that conſtant Prayer was to keep the heart always right towards God, and that a Soul to be internal, ought rather to act with the affection of the will, than the toyl of the intellect,</hi> All this is to be read in her Life.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. The more the Soul rejoyces in ſenſible love, the leſs delight God has in it; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the leſs the Soul rejoyces in this ſenſible love, the more God delights in it. And know that to fix the will on God, reſtraining thoughts and temptations, with the greateſt tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity poſſible, is the higheſt pitch of praying.</p>

Be not diſconſolate, for thou do'ſt not loſe time, nor merit, neither deſiſt thou from Prayer; becauſe it is not neceſſary, that during that whole time of recollection, thou ſhould'ſt actually think on God; it is enough that thou haſt been attentive in the beginning; provided
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:179937:41"/>thou diſcontinue not thy purpoſe, nor revoke the actual attention which thou hadſt. As he, who hears Maſs, and ſays the Divine Office, performs his Duty very well, by vertue of that primary actual attention, though afterwards he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere not, in keeping his thoughts actually fixed on God.</p>
                     <p n="101">101. This the Angelical Doctor St. <hi>Thomas</hi> confirms, in the following Words:
<note place="margin">2.2. quaeſt. 82. art. 13. ad 1.</note> 
                        <hi>That first intention only and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God when one Prays, has force and valve enough to make the Prayer, during all the rest of the time it continues, to be true, impetratory and meritorious, though all that while there be no actual Contemplation on God.</hi> See now if the Saint could ſpeak more clearly to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe!</p>
                     <p n="102">102. So that (in the Judgement of that Saint) the Prayer ſtill continues, though the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ramble upon infinite numbers of thoughts, provided one conſent not to it, ſhift not Place, intermit not the Prayer, nor change the firſt Intention of being with God. And it is certain, that he changes it not, whil'ſt he does not leave his Place. Hence it follows in ſound Doctrine, that one may perſevere in Prayer, though the Imagination be carried about with various and unvoluntary thoughts. <hi>He prays in Spirit and Truth</hi> (ſays the Saint in the fore-cited place) <hi>whoever goes to Prayer with the Spirit and Intention of Praying, though afterwards through Miſery and Frailty his Thoughts may ſtraggle.</hi> Evagatio vero mentis quae fit praeter propoſitum, orationis fructum non tollit.</p>

But thou'lt ſay, at leaſt, art thou not to remember when thou art in the preſence of God, and often ſay to him, <hi>Lord abide within me; and I will give my ſelf wholly up to thee?</hi> I anſwer that there is no neceſſity for that, ſeeing thou haſt a deſign to Pray, and for that end went'ſt to that place.

                     <p n="110">110. Strive then when thou comeſt from Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the end thou mayſt return to it again, not to be diſtracted, nor diverted; but to carry thy ſelf with a total reſignation to the Divine Will; that God may do with thee and all thine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his heavenly pleaſure, relying on him as on a kind and loving Father. Never recal that Intention, and though thou beeſt taken up about the Affairs of the Condition wherein God hath placed thee, yet thou'lt ſtill be in Prayer in the Preſence of God, and in perpetual Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore St. <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaid, <hi>A just man leaves not off to Pray,
<note place="margin">Suner. 5. ad Theſſolon.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he leaves off to be Just. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prays, who always does well; the good deſire is Prayer, and if the Deſire be continued, ſo is alſo the Prayer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="111">111. Thou'lt underſtand all that has been ſaid, by this clear Example, when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins a Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> every ſtep he makes in the Progreſs is voluntary, and nevertheleſs it is not neceſſary, that at every ſtep he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his deſire, or exert a new Act of the Will, ſaying, <hi>I am going to</hi> Rome, <hi>I go to</hi> Rome: Becauſe, by vertue of that firſt intention he had of travelling to <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſame Will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in him; ſo that he goes on without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, though he does not without intending ſo; you'l clearly find, beſides, that this Traveller, with one ſingle and explicit of the Will and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179937:44"/>travels, ſpeaks, hears, ſees, reaſons, eats, drinks, and does ſeveral other things, without any interruption to his firſt intention, nor yet of his actual journying to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="112">112. It is juſt ſo in the contemplative Soul: A man having once made the reſolution of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will of God, and of being in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he ſtill perſeveres in that act, ſo long as he recals not the ſame, although he be taken up in hearing, ſpeaking, eating, or in any other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good work or function of his Calling and Quality. St <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> expreſſeth all this in few words,
<note place="margin">Contra Gentiles, l. 3. c. 138. Un 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Non enim Oportet quod qui propter deum aliquod i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arripuit, in qualibet parte iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris de Deo cogitet actu.</hi>

                     <p n="113">113. Thou'lt ſay, that all Chriſtians walk in this Exerciſe, becauſe all have Faith, and may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not internal, fulfil this Doctrine, eſpecially ſuch as go in the external Way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Ratiocination. It is true, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have Faith, and more particularly they who Meditate and Conſider: But the Faith of thoſe who advance by the inward Way, is much different, becauſe it is a lively Faith, univerſal and indiſtinct, and by conſequent, more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, active, effectual, and illuminated; inſomuch as the Holy Ghoſt enlightens the Soul that is beſt diſpoſed, moſt, and that Soul is always beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, which holds the Mind recollected; for proportionably to the Recollection the Holy Ghoſt Illuminates. And albeit it be true, that God communicates ſome light in Meditation,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179937:44"/>yet it is ſo ſcanty and different from that which he communicates to the Mind, recollected in a pure and univerſal Faith, that the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is no more than like two or three Drops of Water in reſpect of an Ocean: ſince in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation two or three particular Truths are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Soul; but in the internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, and the Exerciſe of pure and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Faith, the Wiſdom of God is an abundant Ocean which is communicated in that obſcure, ſimple, general and univerſal Knowledge.</p>
                     <p n="114">114. In like manner Reſignation is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in theſe Souls, becauſe it ſprings from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and infuſed Fortitude, which grows as the in ternal Exerciſe of pure Faith, with Silence and Reſignation, is continued: In the manner that the Gifts of God's Spirit grow in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Souls; for though theſe divine Gifts are to be found in all thoſe that are in a State of Grace, nevertheleſs, they are, as it were, dead, without ſtrength, and in a manner infinitely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from theſe which reign in contemplative Perſons, by reaſon of their illuſtration, vivacity and efficacy.</p>
                     <p n="115">115. From all which, be perſwaded, that the inward Soul, accuſtomed to go daily at certain hours to Prayer, with the Faith and Reſignation I have mentioned to thee, walks continually in the Preſence of God.

                     </head>
                     <p n="116">116. THere are two ſorts of Spiritual Men Diametrically contrary to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The one ſay, That the Myſteries of the Paſſion of Chriſt, are always to be Conſidered and Meditated upon. The others running to the oppoſite extream, teach, That the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Myſteries of the Life, Paſſion, and Death of our Saviour, is not Prayer, nor yet a Remembrance of them; but the exalted Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, whoſe Divinity Contemplates the Soul in quiet and ſilence, ought onely to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prayer.</p>
                     <p n="117">117. It is certain that our Lord Chriſt is the Guide, the Door, and the Way; as he himſelf hath ſaid in his own Words:
<note place="margin">John 14.</note> 
                        <hi>I am the way the truth and the life.</hi> And before the Soul can be fit to enter into the Preſence of the Divinity, and to be united with it, it is to be Waſhed with the precious Bloud of a Redeemer and Adorned with the rich Robes of his Paſſion.</p>
                     <p n="118">118. Our Lord Chriſt with his Doctrine and Example, is the Mirrour, the Guide of the Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Way and the onely Door by which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179937:45"/>into thoſe Paſtures of Life Eternal, and into the vaſt Ocean of the Divinity. Hence it follows, that the Remembrance of the Paſſion and Death of our Saviour ought not wholly to be blotted out: nay, it is alſo certain, that whatſoever high elevation of Mind the Soul may be raiſed to, it ought not in all things to ſeparate from the moſt holy Humanity. But then it follows, not from hence neither, that the Soul accuſtomed to internal recollection, that can no longer ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinate, ſhould always be meditating on, and conſidering (as the other Spiritualiſts ſay) the moſt holy Miſteries of our Saviour. It is holy and good to Meditate; and would to God that all men of this World practiſed it. And the Soul, beſides, that meditates, reaſons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders with facilitie, ought to be let alone in that ſtate, and not puſhed on to another higher, ſo long as in that of Meditation it finds nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and profit.</p>
                     <p n="119">119. It belongs to God alone, and not to the ſpiritual Guide, to promote the Soul from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation to Contemplation; becauſe, if God through his ſpecial Grace, call it not to this ſtate of Prayer, the Guide can do nothing with all his Wiſdom and Inſtructions.</p>
                     <p n="120">120. To ſtrike a ſecure means then, and to avoid thoſe two ſo contrary extreams, of not wholly blotting out the remembrance of the Humanity; and of not having it continually before our eyes; we ought to ſuppoſe, that there are two ways of attending to the holy Humanity; that one may enter at the Divine Port, which is Chriſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:179937:46"/>our well-being. The firſt is by conſidering the Myſteries, and meditating the Actions, of the Life, Paſſion, and Death of our Saviour. The ſecond by thinking on him, by the application of the Intellect, pure Faith, or Memory.</p>
                     <p n="121">121. When the Soul proceeds in perfecting and interiorizing it ſelf, by means of internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, having for ſometime meditated on the Myſteries whereof it hath been already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; then it retains Faith and Love to the Word Incarnate, being ready for his ſake to do whatever he inſpires into it, walking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Precepts, although they be not always before its Eyes. As if it ſhould be ſaid to a Son that he ought never to forſake his Father, they intend not thereby to oblige him, to have his Father always in ſight, but only to have him always in his Memory, that in time and place, he may be ready to do his Duty.</p>
                     <p n="122">122. The Soul then that is entered into inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal recollection, with the opinion and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an expert Guide, hath no need to enter by the firſt door of Meditation on the Myſteries, being always taken up in meditating upon them; becauſe that is not to be done without great fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue to the Intellect, nor does it ſtand in need of ſuch ratiocinations; ſince theſe ſerve only as a means to attain to believing, that which it hath already got the poſſeſſion of.</p>
                     <p n="123">123. The moſt noble, ſpiritual and proper way for Souls that are Proficients in internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, to enter by the Humanity of Chriſt our Lord, and entertain a remembrance of him,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:179937:46"/>is the ſecond way; eying that Humanity, and the Paſſion thereof by a ſimple Act of Faith, loving and reflecting on the ſame as the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Divinity, the beginning and end of our Salvation, Jeſus Chriſt having been Born, Suffered, and Died a ſhameful Death for our ſakes.</p>
                     <p n="124">124. This is the way that makes internal Souls profit, and this holy, pious, ſwift, and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous remembrance of the Humanity, can be no obſtacle to them in the courſe of internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, unleſs if when the Soul enters into Prayer, it finds it ſelf drawn back; for then it will be better, to continue recollection and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal exceſs. But not finding it ſelf drawn back, the ſimple and ſwift remembrance of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the Divine Word, gives no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the higheſt and moſt elevated, the moſt abſtracted and transformed Soul.</p>
                     <p n="125">125. This is the way that <hi>Santa Tereſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to the contemplative, rejecting the tumultuary opinions of ſome School-men. This is the ſtreight and ſafe way, free from Dangers, which the Lord hath taught to many Souls, for attaining to repoſe, and the holy tranquility of Contemplation.</p>
                     <p n="126">126. Let the Soul then, when it enters into recollection, place it ſelf at the Gate of Divine Mercy, which is the amiable and ſweet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Croſs and Paſſion of the Word that was made Man, and Died for Love; let it ſtand there with Humilitie, reſigned to the Will of God, in whatſoever it pleaſes the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:179937:47"/>Majeſty, to do with it; and if from that holy and ſweet remembrance, it ſoon fall into forgetfulneſs, there is no neceſſity of making a new repetition, but to continue ſilent and quiet in the preſence of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="127">127. Wonderfully does St. <hi>Paul</hi> favour this our Doctrine in the Epiſtle which he wrote to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> wherein he exhorts them, and us, that whether we Eat, Drink, or do any thing elſe, we ſhould do it in the Name, and for the Sake of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Omne quod cum<expan>

                     </head>
                     <p n="128">128. THere are three kinds of Silence; the firſt is of Words, the ſecond of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the third of Thoughts. The firſt is perfect; the ſecond more perfect; and the third moſt perfect. In the firſt, that is, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Words, Virtue is acquired; in the ſecond, to wit, of Deſires, quietneſs is attained to; in the third of Thoughts, Internal Recollection is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By not ſpeaking, not deſiring, and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179937:47"/>one arrives at the true and perfect Myſtical Silence, wherein God ſpeaks with the Soul, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himſelf to it, and in the Abyſs of it's own Depth, teaches it the moſt perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p n="129">129. He calls and guides it to this inward Solitude, and myſtical Silence, when he ſays, That he will ſpeak to it alone, in the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden part of the Heart. Thou art to keep thy ſelf in this myſtical Silence, if thou wouldeſt hear the ſweet and divine Voice. It is not enough, for gaining this Treaſure to forſake the World, nor to renounce thine own Deſires, and all things created; if thou wean not thy ſelf from all Deſires and Thoughts. Reſt in this myſtical Silence, and open the Door, that ſo God may communicate himſelf unto thee, unite with thee, and transform thee into himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="130">130. The perfection of the Soul conſiſts not in ſpeaking nor in thinking much on God; but in loving him ſufficiently: This Love is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by means of perfect Reſignation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Silence, all conſiſts in Works: The Love of God has but few Words. Thus St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt confirms and inculcates it. <hi>My lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children,
<note place="margin">Epiſt 1. Chap. 3. v. 18.</note> let us not Love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="131">131. Thou art clearly convinced now, that perfect Love conſiſts not in amorous Acts, nor tender Ejaculations, nor yet in the internal Acts, wherein thou telleſt God, that thou haſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love for him, and thou loveſt him more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:179937:48"/>than thy ſelf. It may be that at that time thou ſeekeſt more thy ſelf and the love of thy ſelf, than the true Love of God, <hi>Becauſe Love conſiſts in Works, and not in fair Diſcourſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="132">132. That a rational Creature may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſecret deſire and intention of thy Heart, there is a neceſſity that thou ſhouldeſt expreſs it to him in Words. But God who ſearches the Hearts, ſtandeth not in need that thou ſhouldeſt make profeſſion and aſſure him of it; nor does he reſt ſatisfied, as the Evangeliſt ſays, with Love in Word nor in Tongue, but with that which is true and indeed. What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails it to tell him with great zeal and fervour, that thou tenderly and perfectly loveſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, if at one bitter word, or ſlight injury, thou doeſt not reſign thy ſelf, nor art mortified for the love of him? A manifeſt proof that thy love was a love in Tongue and not in Deed.</p>
                     <p n="133">133. Strive to be reſigned in all things with Silence, and in ſo doing, without ſaying that thou loveſt him, thou wilt attain to the moſt perfect, quiet, effectual and true love. St. <hi>Peter</hi> moſt affectionately told the Lord, that for his ſake he was ready, willingly to lay down his Life; but at the word of a young Damſel, he denied him, and there was an end of his Zeal. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> ſaid not a word, and yet the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf taken with her perfect Love, became her Panagyriſt, ſaying that ſhe had loved much. It is internally, then, that with dumb Silence, the moſt perfect Virtues of Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:179937:48"/>are practiſed, without any neceſſity of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God, that thou loveſt him, hopeſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt in him; becauſe the Lord knows better than thou do'ſt, what the internal Motions of thy Heart are.</p>
                     <p n="134">134. How well was that pure act of Love underſtood and practiſed by that profound and great Miſtick, the Venerable <hi>Gregory Lopez,</hi> whoſe whole Life was a continual Prayer, and a continued Act of Contemplation; and of ſo pure and ſpiritual Love of God, that it never gave way to Affections and ſenſible Sentiments?</p>
                     <p n="135">135. Having for the ſpace of three Years continued that Ejaculation, <hi>Thy Will be done in Time, and in Eternity;</hi> repeating it as often as he breathed; God Almighty diſcovered to him, that infinite Treaſure of the pure and continued Act of Faith and Love, with Silence and Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: ſo that he came to ſay, That during the thirty ſix Years he lived after, he always conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his inward Man; that pure Act of Love, without ever uttering the leaſt Petition, Ejaculation, or any thing that was Senſible, or ſprung from Nature. O Incarnate Seraphim, and Dei-fied Man! how well did'ſt thou know how to dive into that internal and miſtical Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and to diſtinguiſh betwixt the outward and inward Man?</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:179937:49"/>the Hand, and immediately taught the myſtical Way. If in the Progreſs of Nature there is a neceſſity of a Guide; how muſt it be in the Progreſs of Grace?

                     <p n="2">2. A Guide is in like manner neceſſary for reſiſting and overcoming the Craft and Wiles of Satan. St <hi>Auſtin</hi> gave many Reaſons why God appointed, that in his Church, Doctors and Teachers, men of the ſame nature with others, ſhould, for Light and Doctrine, have the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: The chief is, to free us from the craft and cunning of the Enemy; for ſhould we be left to our own dictates and natural impulſe, for the conduct of our Actions, we would trip and ſtumble every foot, and at length fall head-long into the Pit; as it happens to Hereticks and proud People: Now if we had had Angels given to us for Maſters, then would the Devils have dazled our eyes by transforming themſelves into Angels of Light: therefore it was convenient that for Guides and Counſellors, God ſhould give us men like our ſelves. And if ſuch a Guide be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, he'll ſoon know the tricks and ſubtilties of the Devil; which being once known, as wanting ſubſtance, they ſoon evaniſh.</p>

When a Soul walks with Fear, doubting if it walk ſafely, and deſires to be clearly rid of theſe fears and doubtings, the ſecureſt way is to ſubmit to a Ghoſtly Father; becauſe by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Light he clearly diſcovers what is Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what Inſpiration, and diſtinguiſhes the motions that ſpring from Nature, from the Devil, and from the Soul it ſelf, which ought totally to be Subjected to him who hath Experience, and he can diſcover the engagements, the idols and bad habits that hinder the Soul's flight; which by this means will not onely be delivered from the Snares of the Devil, but will proceed more in one Year, than it could have proceeded in a thouſand, with other Guides of no Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In the Life of the Illuminated Father, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>John Tauler,</hi> it is related what that Lay-man who went before him in the State of Perfection, ſays of himſelf, How that being taken off from the World, and deſirous to be Holy, he gave himſelf to great Abſtinence, till at length being extenuated and weak, he fell into a Dream, and heard a Voice from Heaven, which ſaid to him, <hi>Man, if thou voluntarily kill thy ſelf, before the time, thou ſhalt pay dear to thy ſelf for it.</hi> Being full of terrour, he went into a Deſart, and there imparted the way he had taken, and his Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, to a holy Anchorite, who, by the favour of Heaven, freed him from that diabolical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. He told him, That he followed that courſe of Abſtinence that he might pleaſe God. But the Anchorite having asked him, By what
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179937:51"/>Advice he did it? And he having made anſwer, By none. The Anchorite replied, That it was a manifeſt Temptation of the Devil. From that time foreward, he opened his eyes, and knowing his own Perdition, lived always by the Direction of a ſpiritual Father; and he himſelf affirmed, That in ſeven Years ſpace he gave him greater Light, than all printed Books whatſoever could do.</p>

                     <p n="8">8. THere is far greater Advantage to be had from having a Maſter in the myſtical Way, than from the uſe of Spiritual Books; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a practical Maſter tells in the nick of time, what ought to be done; but in a Book one may fall upon a thing that is leſs proper, and by that means the neceſſary Inſtruction is wanting: Beſides, by myſtical Books men raiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many falſe Notions, the Soul thinking to have that, which in reality it hath not, and to be farther on in the myſtical State, than as yet it is; whence ſpring many prejudices and dangers.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It is certain that the frequent Reading of myſtical Books, which are not founded in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, but meer ſpeculative Light, does rather hurt than good, becauſe it confounds, inſtead of enlightening Souls, and fills them with diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:179937:51"/>Notions that mightily hinder them; ſince though they be Notices of Light, yet they enter from without, render the Faculties dull, and fill them with Idea's inſtead of emptying them, that God may repleniſh them with Himſelf. Many do continually Read in theſe ſpeculative Books, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not ſubmit to him who may tell them, that ſuch Reading is not convenient for them; whereas there is no doubt but if they do ſubmit, and the Guide be a man of Experience, he will not allow it them: And then they would profit, and not mind ſuch Studies as the Souls do who are ſubmitted, have Light, and make improvement. Hence it follows, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes much to inward Quiet and Security, to have an experienced Guide, who may govern and inſtruct with actual Light, that the Soul may not be deluded by the Devil, nor by its own Judgment and Opinion: However, we do not condemn the Reading of ſpiritual Books in general, ſeeing here we ſpeak in particular of Souls purely Internal and Myſtical, for whom this Book is written.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. All holy and myſtical Maſters confeſs, that the Security of a myſtical Soul, conſiſts in a cordial Submiſſion to its Ghoſtly Father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to him, whatever paſſes within it. And therefore, he who lives after his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without applying himſelf to a ſpiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, (though he take himſelf to be, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Spiritual) oppoſes himſelf to the Doctrine of the Saints, and of enlightned Souls; becauſe the more a Soul is illuminated and united with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179937:52"/>God, the more humble, ſubmiſs, ſubjected and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the ſpiritual Guide it ought to be. For proof of this truth, I'll relate what the Lord ſaid to <hi>Donna Marina d'Eſcobar:</hi> It is reported in her Life, that being Sick, ſhe asked the Lord, If ſhe ſhould be Silent, and omit the acquainting her ſpiritual Father with the extraordinary things that happened in her Soul, that ſhe might not tire herſelf, nor trouble the ſame Father. To whom the Lord anſwered, <hi>That not to give an Account of them to her Ghoſtly Father, would not be well done for three Reaſons: First, Becauſe as Gold is tried in the Furnace, and the value of Stones known by touching them with the Touch-ſtone; ſo the Soul is purified, and the worth of it known, when the Miniſter of God tryes it by the Touch-ſtone. Secondly, Becauſe to avoid Errour, it was convenient that matters ſhould be governed, according to the Order inſtituted by God in his Church, in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and in the Doctrine of the Saints. Thirdly, That the Mercies which his Divine Majeſty ſhews to his Servants and pure Souls, may not be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but made manifest, that ſo Believers may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſerve their God, and he be glorified in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. In the ſame place ſhe hath the following words, conform to the aforeſaid truth: <hi>My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor being Sick, and having enjoyned me that I ſhould not make a full Diſcovery of all things that happened to me, to him, to whom, in the mean time, I Confeſſed my ſelf, but onely of ſome with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: I bewailed my condition to the Lord, that I had not one to whom I might communicate my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:179937:52"/>and his Majeſty made me anſwer,</hi> Thou haſt one already who ſupplies the want of thy Confeſſor; tell him all that happens to thee. <hi>I preſently replied, Not ſo Lord, not ſo Lord.</hi> (Why?) <hi>ſaid the Lord. Becauſe my Confeſſor commanded me that I ſhould not give him Account of all; and I ought to obey him. His Majeſty ſaid to me,</hi> Thou haſt pleaſed me by that anſwer, and that I might hear thee ſay ſo, I ſaid what thou haſt heard: Do ſo; yet ſtill thou mayeſt acquaint him with ſome things, as he himſelf bad thee.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. What <hi>Santa Tereſa</hi> ſaid of herſelf, comes in very pat in this place: <hi>When ever</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>the Lord commanded me any thing, if my Confeſſor told me another, I turned to the Lord, and told him, that I must obey my Confeſſor.

                     <p n="15">15. It is never good to love thy Neighbour, to the detriment of thine own ſpiritual good. To pleaſe God in purity, ought to be the only ſcope of thy Works; this ought to be thy only deſire and thought; endeavouring to moderate thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate fervour, that tranquility and internal peace may reign in thy Soul.

If a Confeſſor would reap Fruit, he is not to look out for any Soul that he may Guide it; it concerns them to come of themſelves, and all are not to be admitted, eſpecially if they be Women, becauſe they are not wont to come with ſufficient diſpoſition: Not to make ones ſelf a Maſter, nor be willing to appear ſo, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means of doing good.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. The Confeſſor is to make uſe of the name of <hi>Daughter,</hi> as little as he can; becauſe it is moſt dangerous, God being ſo Jealous, and the Epithet ſo Amorous.</p>
                     <p n="35">
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:179937:57"/>35. The Employments which a Confeſſor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of, out of his Confeſſion-ſeat, ought to be but few; becauſe God will not have him to be an Agent in Buſineſs; and if it were poſſible, he ſhould not be ſeen, but in his Confeſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chair.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. A Godfather, or Executor to a Man's laſt Will and Teſtament, he ought not, ſo much as once, to be, all his life long, becauſe it brings many diſturbances to the Soul, all of 'um con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Perfection of ſo high a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. The Confeſſor or ſpiritual Director never ought to Viſit his ſpiritual Daughters, not ſo much as in caſe of Sickneſs, unleſs he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be then ſent for, on the part of her that is ill.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. If the Confeſſor procures an inward and outward Recollection, his words will be (though he knows it not) like Coals kindled, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Souls afire.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. In the Confeſſionary, his Reproofs muſt be ordinarily gentle and ſweet, although in the Pulpit they are ſevere and rigorous; becauſe in this he ought to be raging as a Lyon, and in that, he ought to put on the meekneſs of a Lamb: O how powerful is ſweet Reproof for Penitents! In the Confeſſionary they are already moved; but in the Pulpit their blindneſs and hardneſs, makes it neceſſary to frighten 'um: yet theſe ought to be perſwaded and reproved rigorouſly, who come indiſpoſed, and would have Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by force.</p>
                     <p n="40">
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:179937:57"/>40. When all that is poſſible, is done for the benefit of Souls, the Fruit of it is not to be lookt after; becauſe the Devil doth ſubtilly make that ſeem his own, which is God's; and aſſaults with ſelf-Conceit and vain Complacency, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Enemies of Annihilation; which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor always ought to bring about for ſuch a ſpiritual Dying.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Although he often ſee that Souls are not advantaged, and that thoſe which are edified, looſe the Spirit; let him not be diſquieted at this, but poſſeſs himſelf in peace, like the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angels; then let him take courage inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the ſence of his own Sincerity; becauſe ſometimes God ſuffers ſuch a thing, among other ends, to humble him.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. The Confeſſor ought to avoid himſelf, and perſwade the Souls under his Conduct alſo to avoid all ſort of outwardneſs, becauſe it is much abhorred by the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. Although he ought not to order Souls to be Communicated, nor take any Communion from 'em, whether for Tryal or Mortification, (ſince there are infinite ways of Trying 'em and Mortifying 'em, without ſo great a prejudice) yet he ought not to be niggardly with thoſe Souls which are moved by a true Deſire, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt indured not to be ſhut up.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. Experience ſhews us that 'tis a difficult thing to fulfil a Penance, when it is great and immoderate: 'tis always beſt to have it of ſome profitable and moderate matter.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. If the ſpiritual Father ſhews, with any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:179937:58"/>ſingularity, a greater Affection to a Daughter, and ſuch as gives very great diſturbance to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of her Sex: here he muſt uſe privacy and prudence, and muſt not ſpeak to any with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity; becauſe the Devil loves to make ſtrife with the Guide of Souls, and makes uſe of thoſe very words to diſturb others.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. The continual and principal Exerciſe of Souls, purely Miſtical, muſt be in the interior Man, producing with privacy, the deſtruction of Self-love, and the incouraging of 'em to the induring of inward Mortifications; by which the Lord Cleanſes, Annihilates, and Perfects them.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. The Deſire of Revelations, uſes to be a great hindrance to the interiour Soul, eſpecially 10 Women; and there is not an ordinary Dream, but they will Chriſten it with the name of a Viſion. 'Tis neceſſary to ſhew abhorrence to all theſe hindrances.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. Although Silence be a difficult thing to Women, in the things which the Director orders 'em, yet muſt he procure it: ſince it is not good that the things inſpired into him from the Lord, ſhould become the Mark for Cenſures to ſhoot at.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="49">49. THe Confeſſor ought to get Penitents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to Prayer; eſpecially when they often preſent themſelves at his Feet, and make known to him their Deſire that they have of their ſpiritual Good.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. The Maxim which the Confeſſor ought moſtly to obſerve, that he may never come into Perdition, is, Not to accept any Preſent, though the whole World were offered him.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. Though there are abundance of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, yet they are not all good ones, becauſe ſome of 'em know but little; others are very Ignorant; others betake themſelves to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of the Gentry; ſome ſeek the Favours of their Penitents; ſome their Preſents; ſome are full of ſpiritual Ambition, and ſeek Credit and Fame, getting a multitude of ſpiritual Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to themſelves; others affect their Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Command; others affect the Viſions
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:179937:59"/>and Revelations of their ſpiritual Children, and inſtead of deſpiſing 'em, the onely way of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 'em to Humility, they commend 'em, that they may not leave 'em off, and make them write 'em that they may ſhew 'em abroad for Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: All this is Self-love and Vanity in theſe Guides, and great prejudice to the ſpiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Souls: ſince it is certain, that all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and intereſts ſerve onely to hinder the uſe and exerciſe of their Office, with advantage and profit; which requires an univerſal freedom from ſuch things, and whoſe end and aim ought only to be the glory of God.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. Other Confeſſors there are, which with eaſe and lightneſs of Heart, do believe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and commend all Spirits: Others falling into the vicious extream, do condemn, without any reſerve, all Viſions and Revelations; ſuch things are neither to be believed all, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all: Others alſo there are, who are ſo inamoured of the Spirit of their ſpiritual Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that whatever they Dream, let 'em be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much Deceits, they reverence 'em as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Myſteries! O what a world of Miſeries are known in the Church by theſe means! O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confeſſors there are alſo, having on the Garb of wordly Courteſie and Civility, having little regard to the holy Place of the Confeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, diſcourſing with their Penitents concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things vain, ſuperfluous, diſtractive, and far from that decency which the Sacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and from that diſpoſition which ſhould be fit to receive divine Grace; making parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:179937:59"/>like diſcourſes and about the Houſhold Affairs of their Penitents, before they come to Accuſe themſelves of their Sins: whereupon that little Devotion which they brought along with 'em to the Sacrament, becomes cool'd and good for nothing: Sometimes it happens that many Penitents are fain to wait to be Confeſſed, who are full of buſineſs of their own, and when they ſee ſuch a long Demur, they grow weary and ſad, and fall into impatience, loſing the actual diſpoſition of Mind wherewith they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared to receive ſo healthful a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereupon the medley of theſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, ſuperfluous and vain matters, not onely makes 'em loſe their precious time, but alſo prejudiceth the holy Place, the Sacrament; the diſpoſition of the Penitent who is Confeſſed, and that of others who wait to be Confeſſed; all of 'em conſiderable miſchiefs, and worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. For Confeſſion, there are ſome good; but for the Government of Spirits by the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Way, there are ſo few, (ſays Father <hi>John Davila</hi>) that in a thouſand, you ſhall poſſibly find one: St <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> ſays, One among ten thouſand: And the illuminated <hi>Thauler</hi> ſays, That in a hundred thouſand, it was a hard thing to find one expert Maſter of Spirit. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe there are ſo few who diſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to receive the myſtical Science: <hi>Pauci ad eam recipiendam ſe diſponunt;</hi> ſaid <hi>Henry Arpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> (Lib. 3. Par. 3. Cap. 22.) Would to God it were not ſo true as it is. For then there would
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179937:60"/>not be ſo many Cheats in the World, and there would be more Saints and fewer Sinners.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. When the ſpiritual Guide deſires, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that all ſhould be in love with Vertue, and the love which they have of God, is pure and perfect, with few Words, and few Reaſons, he will reap a very great deal of Benefit.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. If the interiour Soul, when it is in the Cleanſing it ſelf of Paſſions, and in the time of Abſtraction, has not a ſure Guide to curb in the Retirement and Solitude, to which its Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and great Propenſion draws it, it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unfit for Exerciſes of Confeſſion, Preaching, and Study, and alſo for thoſe of its own Obligation, State and Calling.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. The skilful Director therefore, ought to mind carefully when the Powers of it begin to be employed in God; that there may not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven too free acceſs to Solitude, commanding the Soul not to omit the outward Exerciſes of its State, as of Study, and other Employments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhould ſeem diſtractive, ſo that they be not contrary to his Calling; becauſe the Soul is ſo much Abſtracted in Solitude, is ſo turned Inward in its Retirement, and is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſuch a degree from Exteriority, that if it afterwards apply it ſelf again, it doth it with toyl and reſiſtance, and with prejudice to its powers, and the ſtrength and ſoundneſs of Head: which is conſiderable hurt, and worthy the weighing of ſpiritual Directors.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. But if theſe have no Experience, they will not know when the Abſtraction is formed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179937:60"/>and at the ſame time, thinking it holy Counſel, will encourage 'em to Retirement, and find De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in it: O how neceſſary it is that the Guide be Expert in the ſpiritual and myſtical Way!</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="58">58. THoſe that Govern Souls without Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, go in the Dark, and arrive not at the Underſtanding of the States of the Soul in their internal and ſupernatural Operations: they onely know that ſometimes the Soul is Well, and that it has Light; other times, that it is in Darkneſs; but what the State of all theſe is, and what is the Root from whence theſe Changes grow, they neither know nor underſtand, nor can verify it by means of Books, till they come to find it experimentally in themſelves, in whoſe Furnace the true and actual Light is made.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. If the Guide hath not paſſed himſelf through the ſecret and painful ways of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Walk, how can be comprehend or approve it? It will be no ſmall favour to the Soul, to find one onely experienced Guide to ſtrengthen it in inſuperable Difficulties, and aſſure it in the continual Doubts of this Voyage: otherwiſe he will never get to the holy and precious Mount of Perfection, without an extraordinary and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Grace.</p>
                     <p n="60">
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:179937:61"/>60. The ſpiritual Director, which lives diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed, longs more for the internal Solitude than the Employment of Souls: and if any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Maſter is diſpleaſed when a Soul goes from him, and leaves him for another Guide, 'tis a clear ſign, that he did not live diſintereſted, nor ſought purely the Glory of God, but his own proper Eſteem.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. The ſame loſs and evil comes, when the Director is ſecretly diligent to draw ſome Soul to his Direction, which goes under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another Guide; this is a notable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; for if he holds himſelf for a better Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector than t'other, he is proud; and if he knows himſelf to be a worſe, he is a Traytor to God, to that Soul, and to himſelf, during the prejudice he does to the advantage and good of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. In like manner there is another conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hurt that diſcovers it ſelf in ſpiritual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which is, that they do not ſuffer the Souls Guided by 'em, to Communicate with others though they are more Holy, Learned, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert than themſelves: all this is Intereſt, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, and Eſteem of themſelves. They do not permit Souls thus to unburthen and vent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for fear they ſhould looſe 'em, and that it may not be ſaid, that their ſpiritual Children ſeek that Satisfaction in others, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find in them; and for the moſt part, by theſe imperfect ends, they hinder Souls from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantaged.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. From all theſe, and infinite other impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179937:61"/>the Director is free that is once arrived at hearing the inward Voice of God, by having paſſed through Tribulation, Temptation, and paſſive Purgation; becauſe that interiour Voice of God works innumerable and marvellous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the Soul, which gives place to it, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to it, and reliſhes it.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. It is of ſo great Efficacy, that it rejects worldly Honour, Self-conceit, ſpiritual Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the deſire of Fame, a wiſh to be Great, a preſumption of being the only Man, and thinking that he knows all Thnigs; it bids adieu to Friends, Friendſhips, Viſits, Letters of Complement, Commerce of the Creatures, Intereſt with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Children, Maſterſhip, and Buſineſs; it turns away too much inclination to Confeſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Affection that is diſorder'd in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Souls, that makes a man think he is fitting for it; it removes Self-love, Authority, Preſumption, treating of Profit, making a ſhew of the Letters which a man writes, ſhewing thoſe written by his ſpiritual Children, to make known what a great Workman he is; it turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Envy of other Maſters and Teachers, and the procuring more Cuſtomers to his Chair of Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. Laſtly, this interiour Voice of God in the Soul of the Director, begets a mean Value, and Solitarineſs, and Silence, and Forgetfulneſs of Friends, Relations, and ſpiritual Children; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes him never remember 'em, but when they are ſpeaking to him. This is the onely ſign to know the Diſintereſtedneſs of a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:179937:62"/>Maſter; and therefore ſuch a one doth more good by being Silent, than thouſands of others that make never ſo great a noiſe with their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Documents.</p>

                     <p n="67">67. Thou wilt never get up the Mountain of Perfection, nor to any high Throne of Peace In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, if thou art onely Govern'd by thy own Will: This cruel and fierce Enemy of God, and of thy Soul, muſt be conquered; thy own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, thy own Judgment, muſt be ſubdued and depoſed as Rebels, and reduced to Aſhes by the Fire of Obedience: there it will be found, as in a Touch-ſtone, whether the Love thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:179937:62"/>be thine own, or Divine; there in that Holocauſt muſt thine own Judgment, and thine own Will be Annihilated and brought to its laſt Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. An ordinary Life under Obedience, is worth more than that which of its own Will doth great Penance; becauſe Obedience and Subjection, beſides that they are free from the Deceits of Satan, are the trueſt Holocauſt which can be ſacraficed to God on the Altar of our Heart. Which made a great Servant of God ſay, That he had rather gather Dung by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, than be caught up to the third Heaven of his own Will.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. You will know that Obedience is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to arrive quickly at Perfection: 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Soul to purchaſe it ſelf true Peace of Heart, if it doth not deny and overcome its own Judgment and Rebellion: And the means of denying and overcoming ones Judgment, is to be willing in every thing to Obey with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, him that ſtands in God's Place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Heart remains free, ſecure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen'd by all that which goes from the Mouth, with true Submiſſion, to the Ears of the ſpiritual Father. (<hi>Effundite coram illo corda ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> Pſ. 61.) The moſt effectual means therefore to advance in the Way of the Spirit, is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print this in the Heart, that a man's ſpiritual Director ſtands in God's Place, and whatever he orders and ſays, is ſaid and ordered from the Divine Mouth.</p>

                     <p n="74">74. THE Soul which is obſervant of holy Obedience, is, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, (35 Lib. in <hi>Job,</hi> Cap. 13.) Poſſeſſour of all Vertues: It is rewarded by God for its Humility and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, illuſtrating and teaching its own Guide, to whoſe direction it ought (as being in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:179937:65"/>God's place) to be every way ſubject, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely, clearly, faithfully and ſimply all the thoughts, all the works, inclinations, inſpirations, and temptations that it knows of it ſelf: In this manner the Devil cannot deceive it; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſecure of giving an account of its actions to God without fear, as well thoſe actions which it doth commit, as thoſe it doth omit. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that whoever would walk without a Guide, if he is not deceived, he is very near it, becauſe Temptation will ſeem Inſpiration to him.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. Thou oughteſt to know, that to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is not enough to obey and honour Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, but it is alſo neceſſary to obey and honour Inferiours.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. Obedience therefore, to make it perfect, muſt be voluntary, pure, ready, chearful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, blind, and perſevering: Voluntary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force and fear: Pure, without worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and reſpect, or ſelf-love, but purely for God: Ready, without reply, excuſe or delay: Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, without inward affliction, and with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: Internal, becauſe it muſt not only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior and apparent, but from the mind and heart: Blind, without ones own judgment, but ſubmitting that judgment with the will: to his that Commands it, without ſearching into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, End, or Reaſon, of the Obedience Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, with firmneſs and conſtancy unto Death.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. <q>Obedience (according to St. <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (Tract. 8. <hi>Collationum</hi>) muſt be ready, without a delay; devout without tyring, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary without contradiction, ſimple without
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:179937:65"/>examination; perſevering without reſting; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly without breaking off; pleaſant without trouble; valiant without faint-heartedneſs, and univerſal without exception. Remember,</q> O bleſſed Soul, that although thou haſt a mind to do the divine Will, with all diligence, thou wilt never find the way, but by the means of Obedience. When a man is reſolved to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by himſelf, he is loſt and deceived: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Soul have very profound ſigns, that it is a good Spirit that ſpeaks to it; yet unleſs it ſubmit to the judgment of the ſpiritual Director, let it be eſteemed an evil Spirit: So ſays <hi>Gerſon,</hi> (<hi>Tract. de diſt. verar. Num.</hi> 19.) and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſters of Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. This Doctrine will be confirmed by that caſe of St. <hi>Tereſa.</hi> The holy Mother, ſeeing that Lady <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Cardona,</hi> led a Life of great and rigid Penance in the Wilderneſs, reſolved to imitate her, contrary to the judgment of her ſpiritual Father, who forbid her: Then the Lord told her (in her Life 366.) You muſt by no means do this, Daughter; the good way thou haſt ſecure; thou ſeeſt all the Penance that <hi>Catherine</hi> doth, but I value more thy obedience. She, from that time forward, vowed to obey her ſpiritual Father: and in the 26th Chapter of her Life, we read, that God often told her, that ſhe muſt not omit to acquaint her ſpiritual Father with her whole Soul, and the graces that ſhe had done her, and that ſhe ſhould always take care to obey him in every thing.</p>
                     <p n="79">79. Thou ſeeſt how God hath been willing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:179937:66"/>to ſecure that heavenly and important Doctrine by the holy Scripture, the Saints, the Doctors, by Reaſons, and by Examples, a-purpoſe to root out altogether the deceits of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

                     <p n="80">80. THat you may know when Obedience is moſt neceſſary, I will adviſe thee, that when thou ſhalt find the horrible and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſuggeſtions of the Enemy, greateſt upon thee, when thou ſhalt ſuffer moſt darkneſs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, drowth, forſakings, when thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelf moſt beſet with temptations, wrath, rage, blaſphemy, luſt, curſing, tediouſneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, impatience, and deſolation; then 'tis moſt neceſſary for thee to believe, and obey an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Director, reſting thy ſelf on his holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that thou may'ſt not ſuffer thy ſelf to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the ſtrong perſwaſion of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who would make thee believe in affliction, and heavy deſertion, that thou art loſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred by God, that thou art out of his favour, and that Obedience is paſt doing thee any good.</p>
                     <p n="81">81. Thou ſhalt find thy ſelf encompaſſed with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:179937:66"/>troubleſome ſcruples, griefs, anguiſh, diſtreſs, martyrdoms, diſtruſts, forſakings of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and troubles ſo bitter, that thy afflictions ſhall ſeem paſt comfort, and thy torments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable. O bleſſed Soul! how happy wilt thou be, if thou doſt but believe thy Guide, and ſubject thy ſelf to him and obey him? Then wilt thou walk ſafe by the ſecret and interior way of the dark night, although thou may'ſt ſeem to thy ſelf to live in Errour, and that thou art worſe than ever; that thou ſeeſt nothing in thy Soul, but abomination and ſigns of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p n="82">82. Thou wilt think verily, that thou art poſſeſſed by an evil Spirit; becauſe the ſigns of this interior exerciſe, and horrible tribulation, ſeem as bad as the invaſions of infernal Furies and Devils. Then take care to believe thy Guide firmly, for thy true Happineſs conſiſts in thy obedience.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. You muſt conſider that when the Devil ſees a Soul totally denying it ſelf, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the obedience of its Director, he makes a ſtrange uproar all Hell over to hinder this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Good, and this holy Sacrifice: Full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and fury as he is, he uſes to make ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two, inſpiring the Soul with weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, anger, averſion, reſiſtance, diſtruſt, and hatred againſt the Guide, and ſometimes he makes uſe of his Tongue to beſpatter him with many Reproaches: But if this Director be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert one, he laughs at theſe ſubtle Snares and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Craftyneſſes And however the Devil
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:179937:67"/>may perſwade the Souls of ſuch a ſtate, with divers ſuggeſtions, not to believe their Director, that they may not obey him, nor profit under him; yet nevertheleſs they may believe, and they do believe enough to obey, though it be without their own ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p n="84">84. Thou wilt ask of thy Guide ſome Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or wilt communicate to him ſome Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. If in denying thee that Liberty, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting that Grace, that thou may'ſt not grow proud, thou withdraweſt thy ſelf from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and leaveſt him, it is a ſign that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was falſe, and that thy Spirit walks in danger: But if thou doſt believe and obey, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he do ſoundly diſpleaſe thee, 'tis a ſign that thou art alive and unmortified; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, thou wilt profit with that violent and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicine: Becauſe, though the inferiour part be troubled and do reſent, yet the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or part of the Soul doth embrace him, and will be humbled and mortified; becauſe it knows that this is the divine Will. And though thou doſt not know it, yet ſatisfaction goes on emproving in thy Soul, and ſo doth the confidence that thou haſt in thy Guide.</p>
                     <p n="85">85. The means of denying ſelf-love, and of laying down ones own judgment, you muſt know, is ſubjecting it altogether with true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Counſel of the ſpiritual Phyſitian. If he hinders you your pleaſure, or demands what you deſire not, thouſands of falſe and idle reaſons do preſently get about his holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; where it is preſently known that the Spirit
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:179937:67"/>is not altogether mortified, nor his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment blinded, which are irreconcileable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to a ready and blind obedience, and the peace of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="86">86. Then 'tis neceſſary to overcome thy ſelf and thy quick ſentiments, to deſpiſe thoſe falſe and lying reaſons, by obeying, holding thy tongue, and executing his holy Counſel, becauſe that is the way to root up thy appetite and thine own judgment.</p>
                     <p n="87">87. For this reaſon the ancient Fathers, as expert and skilful Maſters of Spirit, did exerciſe their Diſciples in divers and extraordinary Ways: To ſome they gave order to plant Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with the leaves downward; to others, to Water dry and withered Trees; to others, to ſew and unſew again. many times, their Cloaths; all marvellous and effectual ſtratagems to make tryal of ſimple obedience and to cut by the roots the weeds of their own Will and judgement.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:179937:68"/>man that knows his Diſeaſe, knows for certain that although he is adry, yet it is not good for him to drink, and that the Phyſick preſcribed him, though it be bitter, yet is profitable for him: Therefore he believes not his Appetite, nor truſts in his own Judgment, but yields him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to a skilful Phyſitian, obeying him in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, as the means of his Recovery and Cure: The knowledge that he is ſick, helps him not to truſt to himſelf, but to follow the wiſe judgment of his Doctor.</p>
                     <p n="89">89. We are all ſick of the Diſeaſe of ſelf-love, and our own judgment; we are all full of our ſelves; we are always deſiring things hurtful to us; and that which does us good, is unpleaſant and irkſom to us: 'Tis neceſſary therefore for him that is Sick, to uſe the means of Recovery; which is, not to believe our own judgments and diſtemper'd ſentiments, but the wiſe Judgment of the ſpiritual and skilful Phyſitian, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply or excuſe, deſpiſing the ſeeming reaſons of ſelf-love; and ſo, if we obey, we ſhall certainly recover, and this love of ours, which is the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of our eaſe, and peace, and perfection, and the ſpirit, will be overcome.</p>
                     <p n="90">90. How often will thine own judgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee? and how much wilt thou change thy judgment with ſhame, when thou haſt truſted to thine own ſelf? If any man ſhould deceive thee twice or thrice, wouldſt thou ever truſt him more? Why therefore, doſt thou repoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thine own judgment, which has ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cozen'd thee? O bleſſed Soul, believe it no
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179937:68"/>more, believe it not; ſubject thy ſelf with true ſubmiſſion and follow blindfold this Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p n="91">91. Thou wilt be much ſatisfied to have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Guide, and wilt eſteem him a great Happineſs; but 'twill little avail thee, if thou valueſt thine own judgment more than his Counſel, and doſt not ſubmit to it in all truth and ſimplicity.</p>
                     <p n="92">92. Suppoſe a great man be ſick of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſeaſe: He has in his Houſe a famous and skilful Phyſitian; and he quickly knows the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, the cauſes, the conditions, and the ſtate of it, and knowing for certain that that Diſtemper is to be treated with ſevere Cauteries, he orders <hi>Lenitives</hi> for it: Now is not this a great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? If he is ſure that <hi>Lenitives</hi> will do little good, and that Cauterizing is the proper way, why does he not apply it to him? Becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſick perſon would have his health, yet the Phyſitian knows beſt, and that he is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to take thoſe ſtrong Medicines, and therefore like a wiſe man, orders him gentle <hi>Lenitives;</hi> becauſe though he may not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get up again by 'em, yet he keeps the Diſeaſe from being mortal.</p>
                     <p n="93">93. What matter is it, if you have the beſt Director in the World, if yet notwithſtanding you want true ſubmiſſion? although he be a man of skill and knows the grievance and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he doth not apply the proper Phyſick, which concerns you moſt to deny your Will; becauſe he knows your very Heart and Spirit,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:179937:69"/>that it is not diſpoſed to let the infirmities of your own judgment be removed. So you will never be cured, and it will be a Miracle, if he can keep you in Grace, with ſo fierce an Enemy of your Soul about you.</p>
                     <p n="94">94. Thy Director will ſcorn all manner of Favours, if he be a wiſe man; as if thy Spirit may not be well grounded, believe him, obey him, embrace his Counſel, becauſe with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if the Spirit be feigned and of the Evil One, the ſecret Pride formed by him that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits theſe Spirits, will ſoon be known; but if the Spirit be real, though thou find'ſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this humiliation, it will ſerve thee for an extraordinary good.</p>
                     <p n="95">95. If the Soul take delight in eſteem, and in having the favours which it receives from God made open and publick; if it doth not obey and believes not its Director, which thinks meanly of 'em, 'tis all a lye and cheat, and the Devil is that Angel that transforms himſelf. The Soul ſeeing that the skilful Director deſpiſes theſe cheats, if the Spirit be evil, withdraws the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affection which it ſhewed him, and indeavours by little and little to get from him, ſeeking ſome other that its cheats may take with: for the proud can never keep company with thoſe that humble 'em: but on t'other ſide, if the ſpirit be true and of God, by theſe means the love and conſtancy increaſes by induring 'em, deſiring much more its own contempt, from whence the ſoundneſs and ſincerity of the Spirit becomes qualified without deceit.</p>

                     <p n="96">96. THere are four things the moſt neceſſary to get Perfection and internal Peace: The firſt is, Prayer; the ſecond, Obedience; the third, frequent Communion; the fourth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Mortification. And now ſince we have treated of Prayer and Obedience, it will be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to treat alſo of Communion.</p>
                     <p n="97">97. You ought to know that many Souls there are that deprive themſelves of the infinite benefit of this precious Food, by judging that they are not ſufficiently prepared, and that no leſs than an Angelical Purity is neceſſary for it. If thou haſt a pure end, a true deſire of doing the Will of God, without looking at ſenſible Devotion, or thine own Satisfaction, come with confidence, becauſe thou art well diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p n="98">98. On this Rock of Deſiring to do the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, all difficulties muſt be broken, all ſcruples overcome, all temptations, doubts, fears, reſiſtances and contradictions: and although the beſt Preparation for the Soul, be often Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, becauſe one Communion diſpoſes it for another; yet I will ſhew the two ways of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:179937:70"/>The firſt for the exteriour Souls which have good Deſire and Will; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for the ſpiritual Ones which live Internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and have a greater Light and Knowledge of God, of his Myſteries, of his Operations and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
                     <p n="99">99. The Preparation for the exteriour Souls, is to be Confeſſed and retire from the Creatures; before the Communion to ſtand ſtill and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is to be received, and who it is that receives it, and that he goes to do the greateſt buſineſs in the World, which is to receive the great God. What a ſingular favour is that Purity it ſelf condeſcends to be received by Filth! Majeſty by Vileneſs! the Creatour by the Creature!</p>
                     <p n="100">100. The ſecond Preparation in order to the interiour and ſpiritual Souls, muſt be to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live with greater Purity and Self-denial, with an univerſal taking ones ſelf off from the World, with inward Mortification and continual Retirement: and when they walk in this Way, they have no need of any actual Preparation, becauſe their Life is a continual and perfect Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                     <p n="101">101. If thou do'ſt not-know theſe Vertues in thy Soul, for the ſame reaſon thou muſt often draw near to this ſoveraign Table to get 'em. Never let it hinder thee, to ſee thy ſelf dry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and cold; becauſe frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Phyſick that cures thoſe Diſeaſes, and increaſes Vertue: for the ſame reaſon that thou art Sick, thou muſt go to the Phyſician; and that thou art Cold, to the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="102">
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:179937:70"/>102. If thou draweſt near with humility, with a deſire of doing the Divine Will, and with the leave of thy Confeſſor, thou mayſt receive it every day, and every day thou wilt grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better. Never be afraid for ſeeing thy ſelf without that affectionate and ſenſible love, which ſome men ſay is neceſſary: becauſe this ſenſible affection is not perfect and ordinarily, it is given to weak and nice Souls.</p>
                     <p n="103">103. Thou wilt ſay that thou feeleſt thy ſelf indiſpoſed, without devotion, without fervour, without the deſire of this Divine Food, ſo as to ask how thou muſt frequent it? believe for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that none of theſe things doth hinder or hurt thee, whilſt you preſerve this purpoſe firm, not to ſin, and your Will determined to avoid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very offence: and if thou haſt confeſſed all thoſe that thou couldſt remember, doubt not but that thou art well prepared to come to this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Divine Table.</p>

O Sovereign Lord, keep back my heart ſtrongly, that it may never more return to its imperfect liberty, but all annihilated may die to the world, and remain united with thee.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="110">110. IT is to be known, that there are ſome Souls, who, to make too great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in Holineſs, become much behind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in it, by doing indiſcreet Penances; like thoſe who would ſing more than their ſtrength allows 'em, who ſtrain themſelves till they are tired, and inſtead of doing better, do worſe.</p>
                     <p n="111">111. Many have fallen into this Precipice, for want of ſubjecting their judgment to their ſpiritual Fathers; whil'ſt they have imagined, that unleſs they give themſelves up to rigid Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they never can be Saints, as if ſanctity did only conſiſt in them. They ſay, that he that ſows little, reaps little; but they ſow no other ſeed, with their indiſcreet Penances, than Self-love, inſtead of rooting of it up.</p>
                     <p n="112">112. But the worſt of theſe indiſcreet Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, is, that by the uſe of theſe dry and barren Severities, is begotten and naturalized a certain bitterneſs of heart towards themſelves and their neighbours, which is a great ſtranger
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179937:72"/>to the true Spirit: towards themſelves, becauſe they do not feel the ſweetneſs of Chriſt's Yoke, the ſweetneſs of Charity, but only the aſperity of Penances; whereby their nature becomes imbitter'd; and hence it follows, that ſuch men become exaſperated with their neighbours, to the marking and reproving much their faults, and holding of 'em for very defective, for the ſame reaſon that they ſee 'em go a leſs rigorous way than themſelves: hence they grow proud with their exerciſes of Penance, ſeeing few that do after 'em, and thinking themſelves better than other folks, whereupon they much fall in the account of their Vertues. Hence comes the envy of others, to ſee them leſs penitent and greater favourites of God; a clear proof, that they fixed their confidence in their own proper diligences.</p>
                     <p n="113">113. Prayer is the nouriſhment of the Soul; and the Soul of Prayer is internal mortification: for however bodily Penance, and all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes chaſtening the fleſh, be good and holy and praiſeworthy, (ſo as they be moderated by diſcretion, according to the ſtate and quality of every one, and by the help of the ſpiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector's judgment) yet thou wilt never gain any vertue by theſe means, but only vanity and the wind of vain-glory, if they do not grow from within. Wherefore now thou ſhalt know when thou art to uſe moſt chiefly Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Penances.</p>
                     <p n="114">114. When the Soul begins to retire from the World and Vice, it ought to tame the Body
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179937:73"/>with rigour, that it may be ſubject to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and follow the Law of God with eaſe; then it concerns you to manage the Weapons of Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, Faſting and Diſcipline, to take from the fleſh the roots of ſin; but when the Soul enters into the way of the Spirit, imbracing internal mortification, corporal chaſtiſements ought to be relaxed, becauſe there is trouble enough in the Spirit: the heart is weakned, the breaſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, the brain is weary, the whole Body grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and diſabled for the functions of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="115">115. The wiſe and skilful Director therefore muſt conſider, not to give way to theſe Souls to perform ſuch exceſſes of Corporal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Penance, to whom he moves the great love of God, which they do conceive in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, darkſom and cleanſing retirement of 'em; becauſe 'tis not good to ſpend the Body and the Spirit all at once, nor break their ſtrength by rigorous and exceſſive Penances, ſeeing they are weakned by internal mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For which reaſon St. <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> ſaid very well in his Exerciſes, That in the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing way, Corporal Penances were neceſſary, which in the illuminating way ought to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, and much more in the unitive.</p>
                     <p n="116">116. But thou wilt ſay, That the Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed grievous Penances. I anſwer, that they did 'em not with indiſcretion, nor after their own proper judgment, but with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their Superiours and Spiritual Directors, which permitted 'em to uſe them, becauſe they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179937:73"/>knew 'em to be moved inwardly by the Lord to thoſe rigours, to confound the miſery of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by their examples, or for many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Other times they gave 'em leave to uſe them to humble the fervour of their Spirit and counterpoiſe their Raptures; which are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Motives and make not any general Rule for all.</p>

                     <p n="117">117. KNow that the Mortifications and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which ſome one undertakes of himſelf, are light (although they may be the moſt rigorous, which hitherto have been done) in compariſon of thoſe he takes from another's hands: becauſe in the firſt, he himſelf enters and his own will, which abate the grief, the more voluntary it is, whilſt at laſt he doth but that which he is willing: but in the ſecond, all that is indured, is painful; and the way alſo painful, in which it is indured, that is to ſay, by the will of another.</p>
                     <p n="118">118. This is that which Chriſt our Lord told St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (St. <hi>John</hi> 21.18.) When thou waſt young and a beginner in vertue, thou girdedſt and mortifiedſt thy ſelf; but when thou goeſt

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and then if thou wilt follow me perfectly, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether denying thy ſelf, thou muſt leave that croſs of thine, and take up mine, that is, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that another crucifie thee.</p>
                     <p n="119">119. There muſt be no difference made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe and thoſe, between thy Father and thy Son, thy Friend and thy Brother; theſe muſt be the firſt to mortifie thee, or to riſe up againſt thee, whether with reaſon or without reaſon, thinking the vertue of thy Soul, cheat, hypocriſie or imprudence, and putting ſtumbling-blocks in the way of thy holy Exerciſes. This and much more will befall thee if thou wilt heartily ſerve the Lord and make thy ſelf pure from his hand.</p>
                     <p n="120">120. Hold it for certain, that however good thoſe Mortifications and External Penances be, which thou ſhalt undertake of thine own ſelf, thou wilt never by thoſe only purchaſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for although they tame the Body, yet they purifie not the Soul, nor purge the internal Paſſions, which do really hinder perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and the Divine Union.</p>
                     <p n="121">121. 'Tis very eaſie to mortifie the Body by means of the Spirit; but not the Spirit by means of the Body. True it is, that in Internal Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and that of the Spirit, it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you, for conquering your Paſſions and rooting up your own Judgment and Self-love, to labour even to death, without any manner of ſparing your ſelf, although the Soul be in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:179937:74"/>higheſt ſtate: and therefore the principal dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ought to be in Internal Mortification; becauſe Corporal and External Mortification is not enough, though it be good and holy.</p>
                     <p n="122">122. Though a man ſhould receive the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of all men together, and do the rougheſt Penances that ever have been done in God's Church, yet if he do not deny himſelf and mortifie himſelf with interior mortification, he will be far from arriving at perfection.</p>
                     <p n="123">123. A good proof of this truth is that which befel Saint <hi>Henry Suſon,</hi> to whom, after 20 years of rigorous Hair-cloth, Diſcipline, and Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence fo great, that even to read 'em is enough to make ones hair ſtand on end, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated light by means of an Extaſie, by which he arrived at the knowledge that he had not yet begun, and it was in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that, till the Lord mortified him with temptations and great perſecutions, he never could arrive at perfection, (his Life, <hi>chap.</hi> 23.)

                     <p n="127">127. The common enemy will make thee believe, that, as ſoon as thou falleſt into any fault, thou doſt not go well grounded in the way of the Spirit, that thou walkeſt in Error, that thou haſt not in earneſt reformed thy ſelf, that thou didſt not make well the general confeſſion, that thou haſt not true grief, and therefore art out of God and of his favour: and if thou ſhalt ſometimes commit again, by misfortune, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial fault, how many fears, frights, confuſions, diſcouragements and various diſcourſes will the Devil put into thy heart? he will repreſent to thee, that thou employeſt thy time in vain; that thou doſt juſt as much as comes to nothing; that thy Prayer doth thee no good; that thou diſpoſeſt not thy ſelf, as thou oughteſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Sacrament; that thou doſt not mortifie thy ſelf, as thou promiſeſt to God daily; that Prayer and Communion without Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is meer vanity: herewith would he make thee diſtruſt of the Divine Grace, telling thee of thy miſery and making a gyant of it, and putting into thy head, that every day thy Soul

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:179937:78"/>endeavour mainly to get Vertues, many Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, Maceration of Body, and Mortification of the Senſes: they give themſelves to rigorous Penance; they put on Sack-cloth, chaſtiſe the Fleſh by Diſcipline, endeavour Silence, bear the Preſence of God, forming him preſent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Idea of him, or their Imagination, ſometimes as a Paſtour, ſometimes as a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and ſometimes as a Father and Lord: they delight to be continually ſpeaking of God, very often making fervent Acts of Love; and all this is Art and Meditation: by this way they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be great, and by the power of voluntary and exteriour Mortifications, they go in queſt of ſenſible Affections and warm Sentiments, thinking that God reſides onely in them, when they have 'em. This is the External Way, and the Way of Beginners, and though it be good, yet there is no arriving at Perfection by it; nay, there is not ſo much as one ſtep towards it, as Experience ſhews in many, that after fifty Years of this external Exerciſe, are void of God, and full of themſelves, having nothing of Spiritual Men, but juſt the name of ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There are others truely Spiritual, which have paſſed by the beginnings of the Interiour Way which leads to Perfection and Union with God; and to which the Lord called 'em by his infinite Mercy, from that outward Way, in which before they Exerciſed themſelves. Theſe men retired in the inward part of their Souls, with true Reſignation into the Hands of God, with a total putting off and forgetting even of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:179937:78"/>themſelves; do always go with a rais'd Spirit to the Preſence of the Lord, by the means of pure Faith, without Image, Form or Figure, but with great Aſſurance founded in tranquility and reſt Internal: in whoſe infuſed meeting and entertainment, the Spirit draws with ſo much force, that it makes the Soul contract Inwardly, the Heart, the Body and all the Powers of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Theſe Souls, as they are already paſſed by the interiour Mortification, and have been clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God with the Fire of Tribulation, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and horrible Torments, all of 'em ordained by his hand, and after his way, are Maſters of themſelves, becauſe they are intirely ſubdued and denied; which makes 'em live with great Repoſe and internal Peace: and although in many occaſions they feel Reſiſtance and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, yet they become preſently Victorious, becauſe being already Souls of Proof, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Divine Strength, the motions of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot laſt long upon 'em; and although vehement Temptations and troubleſome Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the Enemy may perſevere a long time about 'em, yet they are all conquer'd, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite gain; God being he that Fights within 'em.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe Souls have already procured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a great Light, and a true Knowledge of Chriſt our Lord, both of his Divinity and his Humanity: They exerciſe this infuſed Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with a quiet Silence in the inward enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and the ſuperiour part of their Souls, with a Spirit free from Images and external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations,

IN the external Way they take care to do continual Acts of all the Vertues, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, to get to the attainment of 'em: They pretend to purge Imperfections with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtries, proportionable to Deſtruction; they take care to root up Intereſts, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a different and contrary Exerciſe: But though they endeavour never ſo much, they arrive at nothing; becauſe we cannot do any thing which is not Imperfection and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But in the inward Way and loving Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the Preſence Divine, as the Lord is he that Works, Vertue is eſtabliſhed, Intereſts are rooted up, Imperfections are deſtroyed, and Paſſions removed; which makes the Soul free unexpectedly, and taken off, when occaſions are repreſented, without ſo much as thinking of the good which God of his infinite Mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for 'em.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. It muſt be known that theſe Souls, though thus Perfect, as they have the true Light of God, yet by it they know profoundly, their own miſeries, weakneſſes and imperfections, and what they yet want to arrive at Perfection, towards
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:179937:80"/>which they are walking; they are afflicted, and abhor themſelves; they exerciſe themſelves in a loving Fear of God, and contempt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but with a true Hope in God, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence in themſelves. The more they are humbled with true contempt and knowledge of themſelves, the more they pleaſe God, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a ſingular reſpect and veneration in his Preſence. Of all the good Works that they do, and of all that they continually ſuffer, as well within as without, they make no manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count before that Divine Preſence.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Their continual Exerciſe is, to enter into themſelves, in God, with quiet and ſilence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is his Center, Habitation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. They make a greater account of this interiour Retirement, than of ſpeaking of God; they retire into that interiour and ſecret Center of the Soul, to know God and receive his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influence, with fear and loving reverence; if they go out, they go out onely to know and deſpiſe themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But know that few are the Souls which arrive at this happy State; becauſe few there are that are willing to embrace Contempt, and ſuffer themſelves to be Refined and Purified; upon which account, although there are many that enter into this interiour Way, yet 'tis a rare thing for a Soul to go on, and not ſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the entrance. The Lord ſaid to a Soul, <q>This inward Way is tread by few; 'tis ſo high a Grace, that none deſerves it: few walk in it, becauſe it is no other than a Death of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:179937:80"/>the Senſes; and few there be that are willing ſo to Die and be Annihilated; in which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition this ſo ſoveraign a Gift is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>

                     <p n="11">11. Herewith thou wilt undeceive thy ſelf, and perfectly know the great difference which there is between the external and internal Way, and how different that Preſence of God is which ariſes from Meditation, from that which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and Supernatural, ariſing from the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and infuſed Intertainment, and from paſſive Contemplation; and laſtly, you will know the great difference which is between the outward and inward Man.</p>

                     <p n="12">12. IT is the ſaying of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> That to ſerve God, is nothing elſe but to do Good and ſuffer Evil. He that would go to Perfection by the means of Sweetneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, is miſtaken: You muſt deſire no other Conſolation from God, than to end your Life for his ſake, in the ſtate of true Obedience and Subjection.

The Soul that would be United to Chriſt, muſt be conformable to him, following him in the way of ſuffering.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Thou wilt ſcarce begin to reliſh the ſweetneſs of Divine Love in Prayer, but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with his deceitful Craftineſs will be kindling in thy Heart defires of the Deſert and Solitude, that thou mayeſt without any bodies hindrance ſpread the ſails to continual &amp; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prayer. Open thine eyes and conſider that this Counſel and Deſire is not conformable to the true Counſel of Chriſt our Lord, who has not invited us to follow the ſweetneſs and comfort of our own Will, but the denying of our ſelves, ſaying, <hi>Abneget ſemetipſum:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, He that will follow me, and come unto Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, let him part with his own Will wholly, and leaving all things, let him intirely ſubmit to the Yoke of Obedience and Subjection, by means of Self-denyal, which is the trueſt Croſs.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. There are many Souls dedicated to God, which receive from his Hand great Thoughts, Viſions, and mental Elevations, and yet for all that, the Lord keeps from 'em, the Grace of working Miracles, underſtanding hidden Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, foretelling future Contingencies, as he communicates theſe things to other Souls which have conſtantly gone through Tribulations,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:179937:81"/>Temptations, and the true Croſs, in the ſtate of perfect Humility, Obedience and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. O what a great Happineſs it is for a Soul to be ſubdued and ſubject! what great Riches is it to be Poor! what a mighty Honour to be deſpiſed! what a height is it to be beaten down! what a Comfort is it to be Afflicted! what a credit of knowledge is it to be reputed Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant! and finally, what a Happineſs of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes is it to be Crucified with Chriſt! This is that lot which the Apoſtle gloried in, <hi>Nos autem gloriari oportet in cruce Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti.</hi>) (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.) Let others boaſt in their Riches, Dignities, Delights and Honours; but to us there is no higher honour, than to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, deſpiſed and crucified with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. But what a grief is this! that ſcarce is there one Soul which deſpiſes Spiritual Pleaſures and is willing to be denied for Chriſt, imbracing his Croſs with love, <hi>Multi ſunt vocati; pauci vero electi,</hi> (<hi>Matt.</hi> 22.) ſays the Holy Ghoſt: many are they who are call'd to perfection, but few are they that arrive at it: becauſe they are few who imbrace the Croſs with patience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, peace and reſignation.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. To deny ones ſelf in all things, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another's judgment, to mortifie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually all inward paſſions, to annihilate ones ſelf in all reſpects, to follow always that which is contrary to ones own will, appetite and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are things that few can do: many are thoſe that teach 'em, but few are they that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe 'em.</p>

Many Souls have undertaken, and daily do undertake, this Way; and they perſevere all the while they keep the ſweet reliſh of their primitive Fervour; but this ſweetneſs and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible delight is ſcarce done, but preſently, upon the overtaking of a Storm of Trouble, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Dryneſs (which are neceſſary things to help a man up the high Mountain of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they falter and turn back: a clear ſign that they ſought themſelves, and not God or Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. May it pleaſe God, that the Souls which have had light, and been called to an inward peace, and by not being conſtant in dryneſs and tribulation and temptation, have ſtarted back, may not be caſt into outer darkneſs, with him that had not on him a wedding garment; although he was a ſervant, for not being diſpoſed, giving himſelf up to ſelf-love.</p>

                     <p n="21">21. NOw you ſhall know that God uſes two ways for the Cleanſing the Souls which he would perfect and enlighten, to unite 'em cloſely to himſelf: The firſt (of which we will treat in this and the following Chapter) is with the bitter Waters of Afflictions, Anguiſh, Diſtreſs, and inward Torments. The ſecond is, with the burning Fire of an inflamed Love, a Love impatient and hungry: Sometimes he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179937:83"/>makes uſe of both in thoſe Souls which he would fill with Perfection; ſometimes he puts 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtrong ſteeping of Tribulations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward Bitterneſs, ſcorching 'em with the Fire of rigorous Temptation; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he puts 'em into the Crucible of anxious and diſtruſtful Love, making 'em faſt there with a mighty force; becauſe ſo much the greater as the Lord would have the Illumination and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Soul to be, ſo much the more ſtrong is the Torment and the Purgation; becauſe all the Knowledge and Union with God, ariſes from ſuffering, which is the trueſt proof of Love.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. O that thou would'ſt underſtand the great Good of Tribulation! This is that which blots out Sins, cleanſes the Soul, and produces Patience: this in Prayer inflames it, inlarges it, and puts it upon the exerciſe of the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime act of Charity: this rejoyces the Soul, brings it near to God, calls it to, and gives is entrance into Heaven: The ſame is that which tries the true Servants of God, and renders 'em ſweet, valiant and conſtant: that is it which makes God hear 'em with ſpeed. <hi>Ad dominum cum tribularer, clamavi &amp; exaudivit me,</hi> (Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 119.) 'Tis that which Annihilates, Refines and Perfects 'em: and finally, this is that which of Earthly, makes Souls Heavenly, of Humane Divine, transforming 'em and uniting 'em in an admirable manner with the Lord's Humanity and Divinity. It was well ſaid by St <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> That the Life of the Soul, upon Earth, is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179937:83"/>Temptation. Bleſſed is the Soul which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oppoſed, if it doth conſtantly reſiſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. This is the means which the Lord makes uſe of to Humble it, to Annihilate it, to Spend it, to Mortifie it, to Deny it, to Perfect it, and fill it with his Divine Gifts: By this means of Tribulation and Temptation he comes to Crown and Transform it. Perſwade thy ſelf that Temptations and Fightings are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Soul, to make it Perfect.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. O bleſſed Soul, if thou knoweſt how to be conſtant and quiet in the Fire of Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and would'ſt but let thy ſelf be waſhed with the bitter Waters of Affliction, how quickly would'ſt thou find thy ſelf rich in heavenly Gifts; how ſoon would the Divine Bounty make a rich Throne in thy Soul, and a goodly Habitation for thee to refreſh and ſolace thy ſelf in it?</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Know that this Lord hath his repoſe no where but in quiet Souls, and in thoſe in which the Fire of Tribulation and Temptation hath burnt up the dregs of Paſſions, and the bitter Water of Afflictions hath waſhed off the filthy ſpots of inordinate Appetites; in a word, this Lord repoſes not himſelf any where, but where Quietneſs reigns, and Self-love is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. But thou wilt never arrive at this happy State, nor find in thy Soul the precious Pledge of Peace Internal, although thou haſt gotten the better of the External Senſes by the Grace of God, till it become purified from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179937:84"/>Paſſions of Concupiſcence, Self-eſteem, Deſire and Thoughts, how ſpiritual ſoever, and many other Intereſts and ſecret Vices, which lye within the very Soul of thee, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably hindring the peaceable entrance of that great Lord into it, who would be united and transformed with thee.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. The very Vertues acquired, and not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, are a hindrance to this great Gift of the Peace of the Soul; and more, the Soul is clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by an inordinate deſire of ſublime Gifts, by the Appetite of feeling ſpiritual Conſolation, by ſticking to Infuſed and Divine Graces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining it ſelf in 'em, and deſiring more of 'em, to enjoy 'em, and finally, by a deſire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. O how much is there to be purified in a Soul that muſt arrive at the holy Mountain of Perfection, and of Transformation with God! O how diſpoſed, naked, denied, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated ought the Soul to be, which would not hinder the entrance of this Divine Lord into it, nor his continual Communication.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. This diſpoſition of preparing the Soul, in its bottom, for Divine Entrance, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be made by the Divine Wiſdom. If a Seraphim is not ſufficient to purifie the Soul, how ſhall a Soul that is frail miſerable and without experience, ever be able to purifie it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
                     <p n="29">29. Therefore the Lord himſelf will diſpoſe thee and prepare thee paſſively by a way thou underſtandeſt not, with the Fire of Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179937:84"/>and inward Torment, without any other diſpoſition on thy ſide, than a conſent to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external Croſs.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Thou wilt find within thy ſelf a paſſive dryneſs, darkneſs, anguiſh, contradictions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual reſiſtance, inward deſertions, horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, continual and ſtrong ſuggeſtions, and vehement temptations of the Enemy; finally, thou wilt ſee thy ſelf ſo afflicted, that thou wilt not be able to lift up thy Heart, being full of ſorrow and heavineſs, nor do the leaſt act of Faith, Hope or Charity.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. Here thou wilt ſee thy ſelf forlorn and ſubject to Paſſions of impatience, anger, rage, ſwearing, and diſordered appetites, ſeeming to thy ſelf the moſt miſerable Creature, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sinner in the World, the moſt abhorred of God, deprived and ſtript of all Vertue, with a pain like that of Hell, ſeeing thy ſelf afflicted and deſolate, to think that thou haſt altogether loſt God; this will be thy cruel cutting and moſt bitter torment.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. But though thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelf ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſeeming to thy ſelf to be proud, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and wrothful; yet theſe temptations ſhall loſe their force and power upon thee, they ſhall have no place in thy Soul, by a ſecret Vertue, the ſoveragin Gift of inward Strength, which rules in the in-moſt part of it, conquering the moſt affrightening puniſhment and pain, and the ſtrongeſt temptation.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. Keep conſtant, O bleſſed Soul, keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; for it will not be as thou imagineſt, nor

The Lord permits this painful deſertion in thy Soul, to purge and poliſh thee, to cleanſe thee and diſ-robe thee of thy ſelf; and that thou mayeſt in this manner be all his, and give thy ſelf wholly up to him, as his infinite Bounty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely given to thee, that thou mayeſt be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; for although thou doſt groan, and lament, and weep, yet he is joyful and glad in the moſt ſecret and hidden place of thy Soul.</p>

                     <p n="34">34. TO the end that the Soul of Earthly may become Heavenly, and may come to that greateſt good of Union with God, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for it to be purified in the Fire of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and Temptation: And although it be true, and a known and approved Maxim, That all thoſe that Serve the Lord, muſt ſuffer troubles, perſecutions and tribulations: yet the happy Souls which are Guided by God, by the ſecret way of the interiour Walk, and of purgative
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:179937:85"/>Contemplation, muſt ſuffer above all, ſtrong and horrible Temptations and Torments, more bitter than thoſe wherewith the Martyrs were crowned in the Primitive Church.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. The Martyrs, beſides the ſhortneſs of their Torment, which hardly endured days, were comforted with a clear light and ſpecial help, in hope of the near and ſure Rewards. But the deſolate Soul that muſt dye in it ſelf, and put off, and make clean its Heart, ſeeing it ſelf abandoned by God, ſurrounded by temptations, darkneſs, anguiſh, affliction, ſorrows and rigid drowths, doth taſte of Death every moment in its painful Torment and tremendous Deſolation, without feeling the leaſt comfort, with an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo great, that the pain of it ſeems nothing elſe but a Death prolonged, and a continual Martyrdom: whereupon with great reaſon it may be ſaid, that although there be many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, yet there are few Souls which follow Chriſt our Lord with Peace and Reſignation in ſuch Torments.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. Then it was men that Martyr'd 'em; and God comforted their Souls: but now it is God that afflicts and hides himſelf; and the Devils, like cruel Executioners, have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ways to torment the Soul and Body, the whole Man being Crucified within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. Thy ſorrows will ſeem to thee inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thy afflictions paſt the power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and that Heaven rains no more upon thee: thou wilt ſee thy ſelf begin with griefs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged

And although at this time the Lord will not abandon thee, becauſe it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to live one moment without his help, yet the ſuccour will be ſo ſecret that thy Soul will not know it, nor be capable of hope and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; nay, it will ſeem to be without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſuffering, like condemned perſons the pains of Hell, (<hi>Circumdederunt me dolores mortis, &amp; pericula inferni invenerunt me,</hi> Pſ. 114.) and it would change 'em as ſuch, with a violent Death, which would be a great comfort; but (like thoſe) the end of thoſe afflictions and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſes will ſeem impoſſible.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. But if thou, O bleſſed Soul, ſhould'ſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:179937:86"/>know how much thou art beloved and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Divine Lord, in the midſt of thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving torments, thou wouldſt find 'em ſo ſweet, that it would be neceſſary that God ſhould work a Miracle, to let thee live. Be conſtant, O happy Soul, be conſtant and of good courage; for however intolerable thou art to thy ſelf, yet thou wilt be protected, inriched, and beloved by that greateſt Good, as if he had nothing elſe to do, than to lead thee to Perfection, by the the higheſt ſteps of love: and if thou do'ſt not turn away but perſevereſt conſtantly, without leaving off thy undertaking, know, that thou offereſt to God the moſt accepted Sacrifice; ſo, that if this Lord were capable of pain, he would find no eaſe till he has compleated this loving Union with thy Soul.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. If from the Chaos of Nothing, his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence has produced ſo many Wonders, what will he do in thy Soul, created after his own Image and Likeneſs, if thou keepeſt conſtant, quiet, and reſigned, with a true knowledge of thy Nothing? Happy Soul, which, even when 'tis diſturbed, afflicted and diſconſolate, keeps ſteady there within, without going forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare exteriour Comfort.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. Afflict not thy ſelf too much, and with inquietude, becauſe theſe ſharp Martyrdoms may continue; perſevere in Humility, and go not out of thy ſelf to ſeek aid; for all the good conſiſts in being ſilent, ſuffering, and holding patience with reſt and reſignation: there wilt thou find the Divine Strength to overcome ſo
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:179937:87"/>hard a warſare: he is within thee that fighteth for thee; and he is ſtrength it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. When thou ſhalt come to this painful ſtate of fearful deſolation, weeping and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are not forbidden thy Soul, whileſt in the upper part of it, it keeps reſigned. Who can bear the Lord's heavy hand without tears and lamentation? That great Champion <hi>Job,</hi> even he lamented; ſo did Chriſt our Lord, in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakings: but their weepings were accompanied with reſignation.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. Afflict not thy ſelf, though God do cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie thee and make tryal of thy fidelity; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who being reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and injured, did importune and perſevere, humbling her ſelf and following him, though ſhe were treated as ſhe was. It is neceſſary to drink the cup and not go back: if the ſcales were taken from thine eyes, as they were from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, thou would'ſt ſee the neceſſity of ſuffering and glory, as he did; eſteeming more the being Crucified, than being an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. Thy good luck conſiſts not in injoying, but in ſuffering with quiet and reſignation. St. <hi>Tereſa</hi> appeared after her death to a certain Soul, and told it, that ſhe had only been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for her pain; but had not received one dram of reward for ſo many Extaſies and Revelations and Comforts that ſhe had here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in this World.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. Although this painful martyrdom of horrible deſolation and paſſive purgation be ſo
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179937:87"/>tremendous, that with reaſon it hath gotten the name of Hell amongſt myſtick Divines, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems impoſſible to be able to live a moment with ſo grievous a torment; ſo that with great reaſon it may be ſaid, that he that ſuffers it, lives dying, and dying lives a lingring death) yet know, that it is neceſſary to endure it, to arrive at the ſweet, joyous and abundant riches of high contemplation and loving union: and there has been no holy Soul, which has not paſſed through this ſpiritual martyrdom and painful torment. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, in the two laſt Months of his Life; St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſize</hi> two years and a half; St. <hi>Mary Maudlin</hi> of <hi>Pazzi</hi> five years; St. <hi>Roſe</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> fifteen years; and after ſuch miracles, as made the world amazed, St. <hi>Dominick</hi> ſuffer'd it even till half an hour of his happy <hi>exit.</hi>

                     <p n="47">47. THE other more profitable and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious martyrdom in Souls already advanced in perfection and deep contemplation, is, a fire of divine love, which burns the ſoul and makes it painful with the ſame love: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the abſence of its beloved afflicts it; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſweet, ardent and welcome weight of the loving and divine Preſence torments it: This ſweet martyrdom always makes it ſigh;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179937:88"/>ſometimes if it enjoys and has its beloved, for the pleaſure of having him; ſo that it cannot contain it ſelf; other times, if he does not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf, through the ardent anxiety of ſeeking, finding and enjoying him: all this is panting, ſuffering and dying for love.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. O that thou could'ſt but come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the contrariety of accidents, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd Soul ſuffers! the combate ſo terrible and ſtrong on one ſide; ſo ſweet and melting and amiable on the other! the martyrdom ſo piercing and ſharp with which love torments it; and the croſs ſo painful and ſweet withal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever being in the mind of getting free from it whil'ſt thou liv'ſt!</p>
                     <p n="49">49. Juſt ſo much as light and love increaſes, juſt ſo much increaſes the grief in ſeeing that good abſent, which it loves ſo well. To feel it near it ſelf is enjoyment; and never to have done knowing and poſſeſſing it, conſumes its life: it has food and drink near its mouth, whil'ſt it wants either, and cannot be ſatisfied: it ſees it ſelf ſwallowed up and drown'd in a ſea of love, whil'ſt the powerful hand that is able to ſave it, is near it; and yet doth not do it; nor doth it know when he will come, whom it ſo much does deſire.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. Sometimes it hears the inward voice of its beloved, which courts and calls it; and a ſoft and delicate whiſper, which goes forth from the ſecret of the Soul, where it abides, which pierces it ſtrongly, even like to melt and diſſolve it, in ſeeing how near it hath him within it ſelf, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179937:88"/>yet how far off from it, whil'ſt it cannot come to poſſeſs him. This intoxicates it, imbaſes it, ſcares it, and fills it with unſatisfiableneſs: and therefore love is ſaid to be as ſtrong as death, whil'ſt it kills juſt as that doth.</p>

O how many Souls have ſuffer'd themſelves to be lead away, and have loſt the Spirit by this guilded Cheat! Thou wilt never laſt the delicious Manna [<hi>Quod nemo novit, niſi qui accipit,</hi> (<hi>Apoc. ch.</hi> 2.) unleſs thou doſt perfectly overcome thy ſelf even to die in thy ſelf; becauſe he who endeavours not to die to his Paſſions, is not well diſpoſed to receive the Gift of Underſtanding, without the infuſion whereof it is impoſſible for him to go in into himſelf and be changed in his Spirit; and therefore thoſe that keep without have nothing of it.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. Never diſquiet thy ſelf for any accident: for inquietude is the door by which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:179937:89"/>gets into the Soul to rob it of its peace.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. Reſign and deny thy ſelf wholly; for though true ſelf-denial is harſh at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, 'tis eaſie in the middle and becomes moſt ſweet in the end.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. Thou wilt find thy ſelf far from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, if thou doſt not find God in every thing.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. Know that pure, perfect and eſſential Love conſiſts in the Croſs, in ſelf-denial and reſignation, in perfect humility, in poverty of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in a mean opinion of thy ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. In the time of ſtrong temptation, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſolation, 'tis neceſſary for thee to get cloſe into thy center, that thou may'ſt only look at and contemplate God, who keeps his throne and his abode in the bottom of thy Soul.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. Thou wilt find impatience and bitterneſs of heart to grow from the depth of ſenſible, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty and mortified love.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. True love is known, with its effects, when the Soul is profoundly humbled, and deſires to be truly mortified and deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. Many there be, who, however they have been dedicated to Prayer, yet have no reliſh of God; becauſe in the end of their Prayers, they are neither mortified nor attend upon God any longer: for obtaining that peaceable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual attending, 'tis neceſſary to get a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of mind and heart, great peace of ſoul, and an univerſal reſignation.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. To the ſimple and the mortified, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of the ſenſes is a ſort of death: they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:179937:89"/>never go to it, unleſs compelled by neceſſity and edification of their neighbours.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. The bottom of our ſoul, you will know, is the place of our happineſs. There the Lord ſhews us wonders: there we ingulf and loſe our ſelves in the immenſe ocean of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which we keep fixt and unmoveable. There, there reſides the incomparable fruition of our Soul and that eminent and ſweet reſt of it. An humble and reſign'd Soul, which is come to this bottom, ſeeks no more than meerly to pleaſe God, and the holy and loving Spirit teaches it every thing with his ſweet and enlivening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. Amongſt the Saints there are ſome gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ones, who continually ſuffer with patience indiſpoſitions of body, of which God takes great care. But high and ſoveraign is their gift, who by the ſtrength of the Holy Ghoſt, ſuffer both internal and external croſſes with content and reſignation. This is that ſort of holineſs ſo much the more rare, as it is more precious in the ſight of God. The ſpiritual ones, which walk this way, are rare: becauſe there are few in the world, who do totally deny themſelves, to follow Chriſt crucified, with ſimpleneſs and bareneſs of ſpirit, through the loanſom and thorny ways of the Croſs, without making reflexions upon themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. A Life of Self-denial is above all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the Saints; and it doth not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be alive or dead; loſt or gained; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it agrees or reſiſts: this is the true reſigned
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:179937:90"/>Life. But although it ſhould be a long time before thou comeſt to this ſtate, and thou ſhould'ſt think not to have made one ſtep towards it, yet affright not thy ſelf at this, for God uſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon a Soul that Bleſſing in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was denied it for many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. He that deſires to ſuffer blindfold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the comfort of God or the creatures, is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten too far onwards to be able to reſiſt unjuſt accuſations which his enemies make againſt him, even in the moſt dreadful and interior deſolation.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. The ſpiritual man that lives by God, and in him, is inwardly contented in the midſt of his adverſities; becauſe the Croſs and Affliction are his Life and Delight.</p>
                     <p n="66">66. Tribulation is a great treaſure, wherewith God honours thoſe that be his, in this life: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evil men are neceſſary for thoſe that are good; and ſo are the Devils themſelves, which by afflicting us do try to ruine us: but inſtead of doing us harm, they do us the greateſt good imaginable.</p>
                     <p n="67">67. There muſt be tribulation to make a man's life acceptable to God; without it, 'tis like the Body without the Soul, the Soul without Grace, the Earth without the Sun.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. With the wind of tribulation God ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, in the floor of the Soul, the Chaff from the Corn.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. When God crucifies in the inmoſt part of the Soul, no creature is able to comfort it; nay,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:179937:90"/>comforts are but grievous and bitter croſſes to it. And if it be well-inſtructed in the laws and diſcipline of the ways of pure love, in the time of great deſolation and inward troubles, it ought not to ſeek abroad among the creatures for comfort, nor lament it ſelf with 'em, nor will it be able to read Spiritual Books: becauſe this is a ſecret way of getting at a diſtance from ſuffering.</p>
                     <p n="70">70. Thoſe Souls are to be pitied, who cannot find in their hearts to believe, that Tribulation and Suffering is their greateſt Bleſſing. They who are perfect ought always to be deſirous of dying and ſuffering, being always in a ſtate of death and ſuffering: vain is the man who doth not ſuffer: becauſe he is born to toyl and ſuffering; but much more the Friends and Elect of God.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. Undeceive thy ſelf, and believe, that in order to thy Soul's being totally transformed with God, it is neceſſary for it to be loſt and be denied in its life, ſenſe, knowledge, and power; and to die living, and not living; dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not dying; ſuffering, and not ſuffering; reſigning up, and not reſigning up it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting upon any thing.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. Perfection, in its followers, receives not its glories but by Fire and Martyrdom, Griefs, Torments, Puniſhments and Contempt, ſuffered and endured with gallantry and courage; and he that would have ſome place to ſet his feet on and reſt himſelf, and does not go beyond the reaſon of reaſon and of ſence, will never get
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:179937:91"/>into the ſecret cabiner of knowledge, though by reading he may chance to get a taſte and reliſh the underſtanding of it.</p>

                     <p n="73">73. YOU muſt know, that the Lord will not manifeſt himſelf in thy Soul, till it be denied in it ſelf, and dead in its ſenſes and powers: nor will it ever come to this ſtate, till being perfectly reſigned, it reſolves to be with God all alone; making an equal account of Gifts and Contempts, Light and Darkneſs, Peace and War. In ſumm, that the Soul may arrive at perfect quietneſs and ſupreme internal peace, it ought firſt to die in it ſelf, and live only in God and for him: and the more dead it ſhall be in it ſelf, the more ſhall it know God: but if it doth not mind this continual denying of it ſelf and internal mortification, it will never arrive at this ſtate, nor preſerve God within it; and then it will be continually ſubject to accidents and paſſions of the mind, ſuch as are judging, murmuring, reſenting, excuſing, defending, to keep its honour and reputation, which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Perfection, Peace, and the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="74">74. Know that the diverſity of ſtates amongſt thoſe that be ſpiritual, conſiſts only in dying
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:179937:91"/>all alike; but in the happy, which die conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, God hath his honour, his bleſſings and delights here below.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. Great is the difference which is between doing, ſuffering, and dying; doing is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and belongs to beginners; ſuffering, with deſire, belongs to thoſe who are proficients; dying always in themſelves, belongs to thoſe who are accompliſhed and perfect; of which number there are very few in the world.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. How happy wilt thou be, if thou haſt no other thought, but to die in thy ſelf! thou wilt then become not only victorious over thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but alſo over thy ſelf: in which victory thou wilt certainly find pure love, perfect peace, and divine wiſdom.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. It is impoſſible for a man to be able to think and live myſtically in a ſimple under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the divine and infuſed wiſdom, if he does not firſt die in himſelf by the total denying of ſenſe, and the reaſonable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. The true leſſon of the ſpiritual man, and that which thou oughteſt to learn, is, to leave all things in their place, and not meddle with any, but what thy office may bind thee to; becauſe the Soul which leaves every thing to find God, doth then begin to have all in the eternity i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="79">79. Some Souls there are, who ſeek repoſe: others without ſeeking have the pleaſure of it; others have a pleaſure in pain; and others ſeek it. The firſt do as good as nothing; the ſecond are
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:179937:92"/>in the way towards it; the third run, and the laſt fly.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. The diſeſteem of delights, and the count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 'em torment, is the property of a truly mortified man.</p>
                     <p n="81">81. Enjoyment and Internal Peace are the Fruits of the Spirit Divine; and no man gets 'em into his poſſeſſion, if in the cloſet of his ſoul he is not a reſigned man.</p>
                     <p n="82">82. Thou ſeeſt that the diſpleaſures of the good paſs preſently away; but for all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour never to have 'em, nor to ſtop in 'em: for they damnifie thy health, diſturb thy reaſon, and diſquiet thy ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. Amongſt other holy Counſels which thou muſt obſerve, remember well this that follows: Look not upon other mens faults, but thine own: keep ſilence with a continued internal converſation: mortifie thy ſelf in all things and at all hours, and by this means thou wilt get free from many imperfections, and make thy ſelf Commander of great Vertues.</p>
                     <p n="84">84. Mortifie thy ſelf in not judging ill of any body at any time; becauſe the ſuſpicion of thy neighbour diſturbs the purity of heart, diſcompoſes it, brings the Soul out and takes away its repoſe.</p>
                     <p n="85">85. Never wilt thou have perfect reſignation, if thou mind'ſt humane reſpects, and reflecteſt upon the little idol of what people ſay. The Soul that goes by the inward way, will ſoon loſe it ſelf, if once it come to look at reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the creatures, and in commerce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:179937:92"/>with 'em. There is no other reaſon, than not to look at reaſon; but to imagine that God permits grievances to fall on us, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and annihilate us and make us live wholly reſigned.</p>
                     <p n="86">86. Behold how God makes greater account of a Soul that lives internally reſigned, than of another that doth miracles, even to the raiſing of the dead.</p>
                     <p n="87">87. Many Souls there are, which, though they exerciſe Prayer, yet becauſe they are not mortified, are always imperfect and full of ſelf-love.</p>
                     <p n="88">88. Hold it for a true mixim, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can do a grievance or injury to a Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by it ſelf, and one that is nothing in its own account.</p>
                     <p n="89">89. Finally, be of hope, ſuffer, be ſilent, and patient: let nothing affright thee: all of it will have a time to end: God only is he that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable: patience brings a man in every thing. He that hath God, hath all things; and he that hath him not, hath nothing.</p>

God will ſuffer in thee ſometimes one fault, ſometimes another, that by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy ſelf, ſeeing thee ſo often fallen, thou may'ſt believe that thou art a meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; in which knowledge and belief true peace and perfect humility is founded: and that thou may'ſt the better ſearch into thy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and ſee what thou art, I will try to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee in ſome of thy manifold imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p n="91">91. Thou art ſo quick and nice, that it may be if thou doſt but trip as thou walkeſt or findeſt thy way moleſted, thou feeleſt even Hell it ſelf: if thou art denied thy due or thy pleaſure oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thou preſently briskeſt up with a warm reſentment of it. If thou ſpieſt a fault in thy
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:179937:93"/>neighbour, inſtead of pitying him, and thinking that thou thy ſelf art liable to the ſame failing, thou indiſcreetly reproveſt him; if thou ſeeſt a thing convenient for thee and canſt not compaſs it, thou groweſt ſad and full of ſorrow; if thou receiveſt a ſlight injury from thy neighbour, thou chideſt at him and complaineſt for it: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that for any trifle thou art inwardly and outwardly diſcompoſed and loſeſt thy ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="92">92. Thou would'ſt be penitent, but with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's patience; and if the impatience ſtill continues, thou layeſt the fault with much pains upon thy companion, without conſidering, that thou art intolerable to thy ſelf: and when the rancour is over, thou cunningly doſt return to make thy ſelf vertuous, giving documents and relating ſpiritual ſayings with artifice of wit, without mending thy paſt-faults. Although thou willingly doſt condemn thy ſelf, reproving thy faults before others, yet this thou doſt more to juſtifie thy ſelf with him that ſees thy faults, that thou may'ſt return again afreſh to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſteem of thy ſelf, than through any effect of perfect humility.</p>
                     <p n="93">93. Other times thou doſt ſubtilly alledge, that it is not through fault but zeal of juſtice, that thou complaineſt of thy neighbour. Thou believeſt for the moſt part that thou art ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, conſtant and couragious, even to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up thy life into the tyrant's hand, ſolely for the ſake of divine love; yet thou canſt ſcarce hear the leaſt word of anger, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:179937:94"/>thou doſt afflict and trouble and diſquiet thy ſelf. Theſe are all induſtrious engines of ſelf-love and the ſecret pride of thy ſoul. Know therefore that ſelf-love reigns in thee, and that from purchaſing this precious peace, that is thy greateſt hindrance.</p>

                     <p n="94">94. THou muſt know that there are two ſorts of humility; one falſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, the other true. The falſe one is theirs, who, like water which muſt mount upward, receive an external fall and artificial ſubmiſſion, to riſe up again immediately. Theſe avoid eſteem and honour, that ſo they may be took to be humble; they ſay of themſelves, that they are very evil, that they may be thought good; and though they know their own miſery, yet they are loth that other folks ſhould know it. This is diſſembled humility, and feigned, and nothing but ſecret pride.</p>
                     <p n="95">95. Theirs is the true humility, which have gotten a perfect habit of it; theſe never think of it, but judge humbly of themſelves; they do things with courage and patience; they live
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:179937:94"/>and dye in God; they mind not themſelves nor the Creatures; they are conſtant and quiet in all things; they ſuffer moleſtation with joy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring more of it, that they may imitate their dear and deſpiſed Jeſus; they covet to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted trifles and ſport by the World; they are contented with what God alots 'em, and are convinced of their faults with a pleaſing ſhame; they are not humbled by the counſel of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but by the affection of the Will; there is no honour that they look after, nor injury to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb 'em; no trouble to vex 'em; no proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make 'em proud; becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways immovable in their Nothing, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with abſolute peace.</p>
                     <p n="96">96. And that thou mayeſt be acquainted with interiour and true Humility, know, that it doth not conſiſt in external Acts, in taking the loweſt place, in going poor in cloaths, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubmiſſively, in ſhutting the eyes, in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate ſighing, nor in condemning thy ways, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thy ſelf miſerable, to give others to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that thou art humble: It conſiſts onely in the contempt of thy ſelf, and the deſire to be deſpiſed, with a low and profound knowledge, without concerning thy ſelf, whether thou art e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed humble or no, though an Angel ſhould reveal ſuch a thing to thee.</p>
                     <p n="97">97. The torrent of Light wherewith the Lord with his Graces inlightens the Soul, doth two things: It diſcovers the Greatneſs of God, and at the ſame time the Soul knows its own ſtench and miſery, inſomuch, that no Tongue is able
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:179937:95"/>to expreſs the depth in which it is overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being deſirous that every one ſhould know its Humility, and 'tis ſo far from vain-Glory and Complacency, as it ſees that Grace of God to be the meer Goodneſs of him, and nothing but his Mercy, which is pleaſed to take pity on it.</p>
                     <p n="98">98. Thou ſhalt never be hurt by Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but by thy ſelf, thy own proper Pride, and the violence of thy Paſſions; take heed of thy ſelf, for thou of thy ſelf, art the greateſt Devil of all to thy ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="99">99. Have no mind to be eſteemed, when God incarnate was called Fool, Drunkard, and ſaid to have a Devil. O the Folly of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! that we ſhould be willing to enjoy Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, without being willing to imitate him on the Croſs, in Reproaches, Humility, Poverty, and in other Vertues!</p>
                     <p n="100">100. The truly humble man is at reſt and eaſe in his Heart; there he ſtands the tryal of God, and Men, and the Devil himſelf, above all reaſon and diſcretion poſſeſſing himſelf in peace and quietneſs, looking for, with all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, the pure pleaſure of God, as well in Life as Death: Things without do no more diſquiet him, than if they never were. The Croſs to him, and even Death it ſelf, are Delights, though he make no ſuch ſhew outwardly: But oh! who do we ſpeak of? for few there are of theſe ſort of humble Men in the whole World!</p>
                     <p n="101">101. Hope thou, and deſire, and ſuffer, and dye without any bodies knowing it; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:179937:95"/>conſiſts the humble and perfect Love. O how much Peace wilt thou find in thy Soul, if thou do'ſt profoundly humble thy ſelf, and even hug Contempt!</p>
                     <p n="102">102. Thou wilt never be perfectly humble, though thou knoweſt thy own Miſery, unleſs thou deſireſt that all men ſhould know it: then thou wilt avoid Praiſes, embrace Injuries, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe every thing that makes a fair ſhew, even to thine own ſelf: and if any Tribulation come upon thee, blame none for it; but judge that it comes from God's Hand, as the Giver of every good.</p>
                     <p n="103">103. If thou would'ſt bear thy Neighbours faults, caſt thine Eyes upon thine own: and if thou thinkeſt to thy ſelf, that thou haſt made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny progreſs in Perfection by thy ſelf, know that thou art not humble at all, nor haſt yet made one ſtep in the Way of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="104">104. The degrees of Humility, are the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites of a Body in the Grave; that is, to be in the loweſt place, buried like one that's dead, to ſtink, and be corrupted to it ſelf, to be duſt, and nothing in ones own account; finally, if thou would'ſt be Bleſſed, learn to deſpiſe thy ſelf, and to be deſpiſed by others.</p>

                     <p n="105">105. ENcourage thy ſelf to be Humble, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Tribulations as Inſtruments of thy Good; rejoyce in Contempt, and deſire that God may be thy onely Refuge, Comfort and Protector.</p>
                     <p n="106">106. None, let him be never ſo great in this World, can be greater than he that is in the eye and favour of God: and therefore the truly humble Man deſpiſes whatever there is in the World, even to himſelf, and puts his onely truſt and repoſe in God.</p>
                     <p n="107">107. The truly humble Man ſuffers quietly and patiently internal Troubles, and he is the Man that makes great way in a little time, like one that ſails before the Wind.</p>
                     <p n="108">108. The truly humble Man finds God in all things; ſo that whatever contempt, injury or affront comes to him by means of the Creatures, he receives it with great peace and quiet Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as ſent from the Divine Hand, and loves greatly the inſtrument with which the Lord tryes him.</p>
                     <p n="109">109. He is not yet arrived at profound Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility that is taken with Praiſe, though he does
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:179937:96"/>not deſire it, nor ſeek it, but rather avoids it: becauſe to an humble Heart praiſes are bitter croſſes, although it be wholly quiet and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</p>
                     <p n="110">110. He has no internal Humility who doth not abhor himſelf, with a mortal, but withal a peaceable and quiet hatred: But he will never come to poſſeſs this treaſure, that has not a low and profound knowledge of his own vileneſs, rottenneſs and miſery.</p>
                     <p n="111">111. He that is upon excuſes and replies, has not a ſimple and humble heart, eſpecially if he does this with his Superiours; becauſe replies grow from a ſecret pride that reigns in the Soul, and from thence the total ruine of it.</p>
                     <p n="112">112. Perfidiouſneſs ſuppoſes little ſubmiſſion, and this leſs humility; and both together they are the fewel of inquietude, diſcord and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
                     <p n="113">113. The humble heart is not diſquieted by imperfections, though theſe do grieve it to the Soul; becauſe they are againſt its loving Lord: nor is he concerned that he cannot do great things; for he always ſtands in his own Nothing and Miſery; nay, he wonders at himſelf, that he can do any thing of Vertue, and preſently thanks the Lord for it, with a true knowledge that it is God that doth all, and remains diſſatisfied with what he does himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="114">114. The truely humble man, though he ſee all, yet he looks upon nothing to judge it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he judges ill onely of himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="115">115. The truely humble man doth always
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:179937:97"/>find an excuſe to defend him that mortifies him, at leaſt in a found intention: Who therefore, would be angry with a man of good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                     <p n="116">116. So much (nay more) doth falſe humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity diſpleaſe God, as true pride does; becauſe that is hypocriſy beſides.</p>
                     <p n="117">117. The truely humble man, though every thing falls out contrary to him, is neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted nor afflicted at it; becauſe he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and thinks he deſerves no leſs: he is not diſquieted under troubleſome thoughts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Devil ſeeks to torment him, nor under temptations, tribulations and deſertions, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledges his unworthineſs, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected that the Lord chaſtiſes him by the Devil's means, though he be a vile inſtrument; all he ſuffers ſeems nothing to him, and he never doth a thing that he thinks worth any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="118">118. He that is arrived at perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Humility, although he be diſturbed at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as one that abhors himſelf, becauſe he knows his imperfection in every thing, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and his miſery, yet he ſuffers a great croſs in induring himſelf. This is the ſign to know true Humility of heart by. But the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Soul which is gotten to this holy hatred of it ſelf, lives overwhelmed, drowned and ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the depth of its own Nothing; out of which the Lord raiſes him by communicating Divine Wiſdom to him, and filling him with Light, Peace, Tranquility and Love.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Inward Solitude is that which chiefly brings a Man to the purchaſe of Internal Peace.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="119">119. KNow that although exteriour Solitude doth much aſſiſt for the obtaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Peace, yet the Lord did not mean this, when he ſpake by his Prophet, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>I will bring her into ſolitude, and ſpeak privately to her:</hi> But he meant the interiour Solitude, which joyntly conduces to the obtaining the precious jewel of Peace Internal. Internal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude conſiſts in the forgeting all the Creatures, in diſengaging ones ſelf from 'em, in a perfect nakedneſs of all the affections, deſires, thoughts and ones own will. This is the true Solitude where the Soul repoſes with a ſweet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſerenity in the arms of its chiefeſt good.</p>
                     <p n="120">120. O what infinite room is there in a Soul that is arrived at this Divine Solitude! O what inward, what retired, what ſecret, what ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, what vaſt diſtances are there within a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Soul that is once come to be truly ſolitary! There the Lord converſes and communicates himſelf inwardly with the Soul, there he fills it with himſelf, becauſe it is empty; cloaths it with light, and with his love, becauſe it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; lifts it up, becauſe 'tis low: and unites
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:179937:98"/>it with himſelf, and transforms it, becauſe it is alone.</p>
                     <p n="121">121. O delightful Solitude, and Cifer of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſings! O Mirrour, in which the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father is always beheld! There is great reaſon to call thee Solitude; for thou art ſo much alone, that there is ſcarce a Soul that looks after thee, that loves and knows thee. O Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Lord! how is it that Souls do not go from Earth to this Glory! How come they to loſe ſo great a good, through the onely love and deſire of created things! Bleſſed Soul, how happy wilt thou be, if thou do'ſt but leave all for God! ſeek him onely, breathe after none but him, let him onely have thy ſighs. Deſire nothing, and then nothing can trouble thee; and if thou do'ſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any good, how ſpiritual ſoever it be, let it be in ſuch a manner, that thou mayeſt not be diſquieted, if thou miſſeſt it.</p>
                     <p n="122">122. If, with this liberty, thou wilt give thy Soul to God, taken off from the World, free and alone, thou wilt be the happieſt creature upon Earth; becauſe the moſt High has his ſecret habitation in this holy Solitude; in this Deſart and Paradiſe, is injoyed the converſation of God, and it is onely in this internal Retirement that that marvellous, powerful and divine Voice is heard.</p>
                     <p n="123">123. If thou would'ſt enter into this Heaven of Earth, forget every care and every thought; get out of thy ſelf, that the love of God may live in thy Soul.</p>
                     <p n="124">124. Live as much as ever thou canſt, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:179937:98"/>from the Creatures; dedicate thy ſelf wholly to thy Creatour, and offer thy ſelf in Sacrifice with peace and quietneſs of Spirit: Know, that the more the Soul diſrobes it ſelf, the more way it makes into this interiour Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and becomes cloathed with God, and the more loneſome and empty of it ſelf the Soul gets to be, the more the Divine Spirit fills it.</p>
                     <p n="125">125. There is not a more beſſed life than a ſolitary one; becauſe in this happy life, God gives himſelf all to the creature, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all to God by an intimate and ſweet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love. O how few are there that come to reliſh this true Solitude!</p>
                     <p n="126">126. To make the Soul truely ſolitary, it ought to forget all the creatures, and even it ſelf; otherwiſe it will never be able to make any near approach to God. Many men leave and forſake all things, but they do not leave their own liking, their own will, and themſelves; and therefore theſe truly ſolitary ones are ſo few; wherefore if the Soul does not get off from its own appetite and deſire, from its own will, from ſpiritual gifts, and from repoſe even in the Spirit it ſelf, it never can arrive at this high felicity of internal Solitude.</p>
                     <p n="127">127. Go on, bleſſed Soul! go on, without ſtop, towards this bleſſedneſs of internal Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: See how God calls thee to enter into thy inward center, where he will renew thee, change thee, fill thee, cloath thee, and ſhew thee a new and heavenly Kingdom, full of joy, peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſerenity.</p>

                     <p n="128">128. YOu muſt know, that when once the Soul is habituated to internal Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and acquired Contemplation, that we have ſpoken of; when once 'tis mortified, and deſires wholly to be denied its appetites; when once it efficaciouſly embraces internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Mortification, and is willing to dye hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to its paſſions and its own ways, then God uſes to take it alone by it ſelf, and raiſe it more than it knows, to a compleate repoſe, where he ſweetly and inwardly infuſes in it his light, his love and his ſtrength, inkindling and inflaming it with a true diſpoſition to all manner of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p n="129">129. There the Divine Spouſe, ſuſpending its powers, puts it to ſleep in a moſt ſweet and pleaſant reſt: There it ſleeps, and quietly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and enjoys (without knowing it) what it injoys, with a moſt lovely and charming calm: There the Soul raiſed and lifted up to this paſſive State, becomes united to its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good, without coſting it any trouble or pains for this union: There in that ſupream
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:179937:99"/>Region, and ſacred Temple of the Soul, that greateſt Good takes its complacency, manifeſts it ſelf, and creates a reliſh from the creature, in a way above ſenſe and all humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: There alſo onely the pure Spirit, who is God, (the purity of the Soul being uncapable of ſenſible things) rules it, and gets the maſterſhip of it, communicating to it its illuſtrations, and thoſe ſentiments which are neceſſary for the moſt pure and perfect Union.</p>
                     <p n="130">130. The Soul coming to it ſelf again from theſe ſweet and divine Embracings, becomes rich in light, and love, and a mighty eſteem of the divine Greatneſs, and the knowledge of its own miſery, finding it ſelf all changed divinely, and diſpoſed to embrace, to ſuffer, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice perfect Vertue.</p>
                     <p n="131">131. A ſimple, pure, infuſed, and perfect Contemplation, therefore is a known and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manifeſtation which God gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of his goodneſs, of his peace, of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe object is God, pure, unſpeakable, abſtracted from all particular thoughts, within an inward ſilence: but it is God delightful, God that draws us, God that ſweetly raiſes us in a ſpiritual and moſt pure manner; an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gift, which the Divine Majeſty beſtows to whom he will, as he will, and when he will, and for what time he will, though the ſtate of this life be rather a ſtate of the croſs, of patience, of humility, and of ſuffering, than of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="132">132. Never wilt thou enjoy this Divine Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctar,

And how can the pure Spirit be heard in the midſt of conſiderations and diſcourſes of Artifice? If the Soul will not continually dye in it ſelf, denying it ſelf to all theſe materiallites and ſatisfactions, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation can be no more but a meer vanity, a vain complacency and preſumption.</p>

                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:179937:100"/>134. Sometimes the Lord gives greater light to the underſtanding; ſometimes greater love to the will. There is no need here for the Soul to take any pains or trouble; it muſt receive what God gives it, and reſt united, as he will have it; becauſe His Majeſty is Lord, and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time that he lays it aſleep, he poſſeſſes and fills it, and works in it powerfully and ſweetly, without any induſtry or knowledge of its own: inſomuch, that before ever it is aware of this ſo great mercy, it is gained, convinced, and changed already.</p>
                     <p n="135">135. The Soul which is in this happy ſtate, hath two things to avoid, the activity of human ſpirit, and intereſtedneſs: Our humane ſpirit is unwilling to dye in it ſelf, but loveth to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcourſing after its way, being in love with its own actions. A man had need to have a great fidelity, and deveſting himſelf of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, to get a perfect and paſſive capacity of the Divine Influences; the continual habits of operating freely, which it has, are a hindrance to its annihilation.</p>
                     <p n="136">136. The ſecond is intereſtedneſs in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation it ſelf: Thou muſt therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in thy Soul a perfect deveſting of all which is not God, without ſeeking any other end or intereſt, within or without, but the Divine Will.</p>
                     <p n="137">137. In a word, the manner that thou muſt uſe, on thy part, to fit thy ſelf for this pure, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and perfect Prayer, is, a total and abſolute conſignment of thy ſelf into the hands of God,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:179937:101"/>with a perfect ſubmiſſion to his moſt holy will, to be buſied according to his pleaſure and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, receiving what he ordains thee, with an even and perfect reſignation.</p>
                     <p n="138">138. Thou muſt know, that few be the Souls which arrive at this infuſed and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Prayer; becauſe few of 'em are capable of theſe divine influences with a total nakedneſs and death of their own activity and powers: thoſe onely which feel it, know it ſo, that this perfect nakedneſs is acquired (by the help of God's grace) by a continual and inward mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, dying to it all its own inclinations and deſires.</p>
                     <p n="139">139. At no time muſt thou look at the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which are wrought in thy Soul, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially herein; becauſe it would be a hindrance to the divine operations, which inrich it, ſo to do: all that thou haſt to do is to pant after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, reſignation, forgetfulneſs, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy being ſenſible of it; the greateſt good will leave in thy Soul a fit diſpoſition for the practice of vertue, a true love of the croſs of thy own contempt, of thy annihilation, and greater and ſtronger deſires ſtill of thy greater perfection and the moſt pure and affective union.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of the two Means, whereby the Soul aſcends up to Infuſed Contemplation, with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what and how many the ſteps of it are.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="140">140. THE means whereby the Soul aſcends to the felicity of Contemplation and Affective Love, are two; the Pleaſure, and the Deſires of it. God uſes at firſt to fill the Soul with ſenſible pleaſures; becauſe 'tis ſo frail and miſerable, that without this preventive Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it cannot take wing towards the fruition of heavenly things. In this firſt ſtep it is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Contrition, and is exerciſed in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, meditating upon the Redeemer's Paſſion, rooting out diligently all worldly deſires and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious courſes of life: becauſe the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence, and the faint-heard, the delicate never conquer it, but thoſe that uſe violence and force with themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="141">141. The ſecond is the Deſires. The more the things of Heaven are delighted in, the more they are deſired; and from thence there do enſue upon ſpiritual pleaſures, deſires of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying heavenly and divine bleſſings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of worldly ones. From theſe deſires ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the inclination of following Chriſt our Lord,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:179937:102"/>who ſaid, <hi>I am the way,</hi> (St. <hi>John</hi> 14.6.) the ſteps of his imitation, by which a man muſt go up, are Charity, Humility, Meekneſs, Patience, Poverty, Self-Contempt, the Croſs, Prayer and Mortification.</p>
                     <p n="142">142. The ſteps of Infuſed Contemplation are three. The firſt is Satiety. When the Soul is fill'd with God, it conceives a hatred to all worldly things; then 'tis quiet and ſatisfied only with Divine Love.</p>
                     <p n="143">143. The ſecond is Intoxication. And this ſtep is an exceſs of Mind, and an elevation of Soul, ariſing from Divine Love and ſatiety of it.</p>
                     <p n="144">144. The third is Security. This ſtep turns out all fear: the Soul is ſo drencht with love divine, and reſigned up in ſuch a manner to the divine good pleaſure, that it would go wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to Hell, if it did but know it ſo to be the will of the Moſt High. In this ſtep it feels ſuch a certain Bond of the Divine Union, that it ſeems to it an impoſſible thing, to be seſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from its beloved and his infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p n="145">145. There are ſix other ſteps of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which are theſe, Fire, Union, Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Illumination, Pleaſure, and Repoſe. With the firſt the Soul is inkindled, and being inkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, is anointed; being anointed, is raiſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed, contemplates; contemplating, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives pleaſure; and receiving pleaſure, it finds repoſe. By theſe ſteps the Soul riſes higher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſtracted and experienced in the Spiritual and Internal Way.</p>
                     <p n="146">
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:179937:102"/>146. In the firſt ſtep, which is Fire, the Soul is illuſtrated, by the means of a divine and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ray, in kindling the affections divine, and drying up thoſe which are but humane. The ſecond is the Unction, which is a ſweet and ſpiritual Liquor, which diffuſing it ſelf all the Soul over, teaches it, ſtrengthens it, and diſpoſes it to receive and contemplate the divine truth: and ſometimes it extends even to nature it ſelf, corroborating it by patience, with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pleaſure that ſeems celeſtial.</p>
                     <p n="147">147. The third is the Elevation of the Inner Man over it ſelf, that it may get fitteſt to the clear fountain of pure love.</p>
                     <p n="148">148. The fourth ſtep, which is Illumination, is an infuſed knowledge, whereby the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates ſweetly the divine truth, riſing ſtill from one clearneſs to another, from one light to another, from knowledge to knowledge, being guided by the Spirit Divine.</p>
                     <p n="149">149. The fifth is a Savoury Pleaſure of the Divine Sweetneſs, iſſuing forth from the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and precious Fountain of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="150">150. The ſixth is a Sweet and Admirable Tranquility, ariſing from the conqueſt of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within, and frequent Prayer; and this, <hi>very, very</hi> few have experience of. Here the abundance of Joy and Peace is ſo great, that the Soul ſeems to be in a ſweet ſleep, ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and repoſing it ſelf in the divine breaſt of love.</p>
                     <p n="151">151. Many other ſteps of Contemplation
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:179937:103"/>there are, as Extaſies, Raptures, Melting, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium's,</hi> Glee, Kiſſes, Embraces, Exultation, Union, Transformation, Eſpouſing, and Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which I omit to explain, to give no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeculation: And becauſe there are whole Books which treat of theſe Points; though they are all for him who finds nothing of 'em, any more than a blind man doth of Colour, or a deaf man of Muſick. In a word, by theſe ſteps we get up to the chamber and repoſe of the pacifick King and the true <hi>Solomon.</hi>

                     <p n="152">152. THE Signs to know the Inner Man by, are four. The firſt, If the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding produce no other Thoughts than thoſe which ſtir up to the light of Faith; and the Will is ſo habituated, that it begets no other Acts of Love, than of God, and in order to him. The ſecond, If, when he ceaſes from an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Work, in which he was employed, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and the Will are preſently and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily turned to God. The third, If in entring, upon Prayer, he forgets all outward things, as if he had not ſeen nor uſed 'em. The fourth, If he carries himſelf orderly towards outward
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:179937:103"/>things, as if he were entring into the World again, fearing to embroil himſelf in buſineſs, and naturally abhorring it, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leſs when charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of him.</p>
                     <p n="153">153. Such a Soul as this is free from the Outward Man, and eaſily enters into the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſolitude, where it ſees none but God and it ſelf in him: loving him with quiet and peace and true love. There in that ſecret center God is kindly ſpeaking to it, teaching it a new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and true Peace and Joy.</p>
                     <p n="154">154. This ſpiritual, abſtracted and retired Soul hath its peace no more broken, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it may meet with combats; becauſe, through the infinite diſtance, tempeſts do never reach to that ſereneſt heaven within, where pure and perfect love reſides; and though ſometimes it may be naked, forſaken, fought againſt and deſolate, this is only the fury of the ſtorm, which threatens and rages no where but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                     <p n="155">155. This ſecret love within, hath four ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: The firſt is called Illumination, which is a ſavoury and experimental knowledge of the greatneſs of God, and of its own nothing. The ſecond is Inflammation, which is an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being burnt, like the <hi>Salamander,</hi> in this kind and divine fire. The third is Sweetneſs, which is a peaceable, joyful, ſweet and intimate fruition. The fourth, is a ſwallowing up of the powers in God; by which immerſion the Soul is ſo much drencht and fill'd with God, that it can't any longer ſeek, deſire, or will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:179937:104"/>any thing, but its greateſt and infinite good.</p>
                     <p n="156">156. From this fulleſt ſatiety, two effects ariſe. The firſt is, a great courage to ſuffer for God. The ſecond is, a certain hope or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it can never loſe him, nor be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from him.</p>
                     <p n="157">157. Here in this internal retirement, the beloved Jeſus hath his Paradiſe, to whom we may go up, ſtanding and converſing on the Earth. And if thou deſireſt to know who he is, who is altogether drawn to this inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, with enlightened exemplification in God, I tell thee, it is he that in adverſity, in diſcomfort of ſpirit, and in the want of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſtands firm and unſhaken. Theſe conſtant and inward Souls are outwardly naked and wholly diffuſed in God, whom they continually do contemplate: they have no ſpot; they live in God and of him himſelf; they ſhine brighter than a thouſand Suns; they are beloved by the Son of God; they are the darlings of God the Father, and Elect Spouſes of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="158">158. By three ſigns is a mind that is purged, to be known, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays in a Treatiſe of his. The firſt ſign is diligence, which is a ſtrength of mind, which baniſhes all neglect and ſloth, that it may be diſpoſed with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confidence to the purſuit of vertue. The ſecond is ſeverity; which likewiſe is a ſtrength of mind againſt concupiſcence, accompanied with an ardent love of roughneſs, vileneſs and holy poverty. The third is benignity and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, which drives away all rancour,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:179937:104"/>envy, averſion and hatred againſt ones neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p n="159">159. Till the mind be purg'd, the affection purified, the memory naked, the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brightened, the will denied and ſet afire, the Soul can never arrive at the intimate and affective union with God, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpirit of God is purity it ſelf, and light and reſt, the ſoul, where he intends to make his abode, muſt have great purity, peace, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and quiet. Finally, the precious gift of a purg'd mind, thoſe only have, who with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual diligence do ſeek love and retain it, and deſire to be reputed the moſt vile in the World.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="160">160. DIvine Wiſdom is an intellectual and infuſed knowledge of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and things eternal; which ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called Contemplation than Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Science is acquired and begets the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature. Wiſdom is infuſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the knowledge of the Divine Goodneſs. That deſires to know what is not to be attained unto without pains and ſweat: This deſires not to know what it doth know, although it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:179937:105"/>it all. In a word, the men who are ſcientifical entertain themſelves in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things of the world; and the wiſe live ſwallowed up in God himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="161">161. Reaſon enlightened in the Wiſe is a high and ſimple elevation of ſpirit, whereby he ſees, with a clear and ſharp ſight all that is inferiour to him, and what concerns his Life and Eſtate. This is that which renders the ſoul ſimple, illuſtrated, uniform, ſpiritual, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther introverted and abſtracted from every created thing. This moves and draws away with a ſweet violence, the hearts of the humble and teachable, filling them with abundance of ſweetneſs, peace, and pleaſantneſs. Finally, the wiſe man ſays of it, that it brought him all good things at once. <hi>Venerunt mihi omnia bona pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cum illa,</hi> Wiſd. 7.11.</p>
                     <p n="162">162. You muſt know, that the greateſt part of men lives by opinion, and judges according to the deceivableneſs of imagination and ſence: but the man that's wiſe judges of every thing according to the real verity, which is in it; whoſe buſineſs is to underſtand, conceive, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into, and tranſcend every created being, even to himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="163">163. 'Tis a great property of a wiſe man to do much and ſay little.</p>
                     <p n="164">164. Wiſdom is diſcovered in the works and words of the wiſe; becauſe he being abſolute maſter of all his paſſions, motions, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, is known in all his doings, like a quiet and ſtill water, in which wiſdom ſhines with clearneſs.</p>
                     <p n="165">
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:179937:105"/>165. The underſtanding of myſtical truths is ſecret and ſhut up from men who are purely ſcholaſtical, unleſs they be humble; becauſe it is the ſcience of Saints, and none know it but thoſe which heartily love and ſeek their own contempt: Therefore the Souls, who by imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this means, get to be purely myſtical and truly humble, dive even to the profoundeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Divinity: And the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually men do live according to fleſh and bloud, the greater diſtance are they at from this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Science.</p>
                     <p n="166">166. Ordinarily it is ſeen that in the man which hath much ſcholaſtical and ſpeculative Knowledge, Divine Wiſdom doth not predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; yet they make an admirable compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, when they both meet together. The men of Learning, who by God's mercy have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this myſtick Science, are worthy of Veneration and Praiſe in Religion.</p>
                     <p n="167">167. The external actions of the myſtical and wiſe, which they do rather paſſively than actively, though they are a great torment to 'em, yet are ordered prudently by 'em, by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, weight and meaſure.</p>
                     <p n="168">168. The Sermons of men of Learning, who want the Spirit, though they are made up of divers ſtories, elegant deſcriptions, acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and exquiſite proofs, yet are by no means the word of God, but the word of men, plated over with falſe Gold: Theſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſpoil Chriſtians, feeding 'em with wind and vanity, and ſo they are, both of 'em, void of God.</p>
                     <p n="169">
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:179937:106"/>169. Theſe Teachers feed their Hearers with the wind of hurtful ſubtilties, giving 'em ſtones inſtead of bread, leaves inſtead of fruit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory earth mixt with poiſoned honey inſtead of true food. Theſe are they that hunt after honour, raiſing up an idol of reputation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, inſtead of ſeeking God's glory, and the ſpiritual edification of men.</p>
                     <p n="170">170. Thoſe that preach with zeal and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, preach for God. Thoſe that preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 'em, preach for themſelves. Thoſe that preach the word of God with Spirit, make it take impreſſion in the heart: but thoſe that preach it without Spirit, carry it no farther than to the ear.</p>
                     <p n="171">171. Perfection doth not conſiſt in teaching it, but in doing it; becauſe he is neither the greateſt Saint, nor the wiſeſt Man, that knows the truth moſt, but he that practices it.</p>
                     <p n="172">172. 'Tis a conſtant Maxim, That Divine Wiſdom begets Humility; and that which is acquired by the Learned, begets Pride.</p>
                     <p n="173">173. Holineſs does not conſiſt in forming deep and ſubtle conceits of the knowledge and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, but in the love of God, and in ſelf-denial. Therefore 'tis frequentlier obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Holineſs is more amongſt the ſimple and humble, than among the learned. How many poor old women are there in the World, which have little or nothing of humane Science, but are rich in the love of God! How many Divines do we ſee that are over head and ears in their vain wiſdom, and yet very bare in things of true light and charity!</p>
                     <p n="174">
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:179937:106"/>174. Remember that 'tis always good to ſpeak like one that learns, and not like one that knows: Count it a greater honour to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a meer Ignoramus, than a man of Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
                     <p n="175">175. However, the Learned, who are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeculative, have ſome little ſparks of Spirit, yet theſe do not fly out from the ſimple bottom of eminent and divine Wiſdom, which hath a mortal hatred to forms and ſpecies's: the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a little Science is always a hindrance to the eternal, profound, pure, ſimple, and true Wiſdom.</p>

The Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who follow Scientifical Speculation by the ſweetneſs of ſenſible Diſcourſes, get up to God by this means, as well as they can, that by this help they may be able to love him: But none of thoſe who follow that way which they call ſcolaſtical, ever arrives by that onely, to the myſtical Way, or to the excellence of Union, Transformation, Simplicity, Light, Peace, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,

The Spirit of Divine Wiſdom fills men with ſweetneſs, governs 'em with courage and inlightens thoſe with excellence who are ſubject to its direction. Where the Divine Spirit dwells, there is always ſimplicity and a holy liberty. But craft and double-mindedneſs, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, artifices, policy, and wordly reſpects, are Hell it ſelf, to wiſe and ſincere men.</p>

This laſt is the compleateſt of all; becauſe that Soul one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that knows how to be ſo taken off, is that which attains to being loſt in God, and onely knows where to be in ſafety.</p>
                     <p n="186">186. God is more ſatisfied with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart, than that of worldly Science. 'Tis one thing to cleanſe the Heart of all that which captivates and pollutes it; and another thing to do a thouſand things, though good and holy, without minding that purity of Heart, which is the main of all for attaining of Divine Wiſdom.</p>

                     <p n="189">189. THou muſt know that all this fabrick of Annihilation hath its foundation but in two Principles. The firſt is, To keep ones ſelf and all wordly things in a low eſteem and value; from whence the putting in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Self-deveſting, and of Self-renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and forſaking all created things, muſt have its riſe, and that with the affection, and in deed.</p>
                     <p n="190">
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:179937:109"/>190. The ſecond Principle muſt be a great eſteem of God, to love, adore, and follow him without the leaſt intereſt of ones own, let it be never ſo holy. From theſe two Principles will ariſe a full conformity to the Divine Will. This powerful and practical conformity to the Divine Will in all things, leads the Soul to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation and Transformation with God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of Raptures, or external Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or vehement Affections: This way being liable to many illuſions, with the danger of weakneſs and anguiſh of the underſtanding, by which path there is ſeldom any that gets up to the top of Perfection, which is acquired by t'other ſafe, firm and real way, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a weighty Croſs; becauſe therein the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Annihilation and Perfection is founded; which is ſeconded by many gifts of Light and Divine effects, and infinite other Graces, <hi>Gratis datae:</hi> yet the Soul that is Annihilated muſt be uncloathed of it all, if it would not have 'em be a hindrance to it in its way to Deificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="191">191. As the Soul makes continual progreſs from its own meanneſs, it ought to walk on to the practice of Annihilation, which conſiſts in the abhorring of Honour, Dignity, and Praiſe; there being no reaſon that Dignity and Honour ſhould be given to Vileneſs, and a meer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p n="192">192. To the Soul that is ſenſible of its own Vileneſs, it appears an impoſſible thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any thing; 'tis rather confounded and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:179937:109"/>knows it ſelf unworthy of Vertue and Praiſe: it embraces with equal courage all occaſions of Contempt, Perſecution, Infamy, Shame, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; and as truly deſerving of ſuch reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it renders the Lord thanks, when it lights upon ſuch occaſions, to be treated as it deſerves; and knows it ſelf alſo unworthy, that he ſhould uſe his juſtice upon it; but above all, 'tis glad of contempt and affront, becauſe its God gets great glory by it.</p>
                     <p n="193">193. Such a Soul as this always chooſes the loweſt, the vileſt, and the moſt deſpiſed degree, as well of place, as of cloathing, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, without the leaſt affectation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity; being of the opinion, that the greateſt Vileneſs is beyond its deſerts, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf alſo unworthy even of this. This is the practice that brings the Soul to a true Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="194">194. The Soul that would be perfect, begins to Mortifie its Paſſions; and when 'tis advanced in that Exerciſe, it denys it ſelf; then, with the Divine Aid, it paſſes to the ſtate of Nothing, where it deſpiſes, abhors, and plunges it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knowledge that it is Nothing, that it can do nothing, and that it is worth nothing: From hence ſprings the dying in it ſelf, and in its ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in many ways, and at all hours; and finally, from this ſpiritual Death the true and perfect Annihilation derives its original; inſomuch, that when the Soul is once dead to its will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, 'tis properly ſaid to be arrived at the perfect and happy ſtate of Annihilation, which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:179937:110"/>is the laſt diſpoſition for Transformation and Union, which the Soul it ſelf doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, becauſe 'twould not be Annihilated if it ſhould come to know it: And although it de get to this happy ſtate of Annihilation, yet it muſt know, that it muſt walk ſtill on, and muſt be further and further Purified and Annihilated. [Here is moſt delicious Nonſence, and a very curious Bull.]</p>
                     <p n="195">195. You muſt know, that this annihilation, to make it perfect in the Soul, muſt be in a man's own judgment, in his will, in his works, inclinations, deſires, thoughts, and in it ſelf: ſo that the Soul muſt find it ſelf dead to its will, deſire, endeavour, underſtanding, and thought; willing, as if it did not will; deſiring, as if it did not deſire; underſtanding, as if it did not underſtand; thinking, as if it did not think, without inclining to any thing; embracing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually contempts and honours, benefits and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. O what a happy Soul is that which is thus dead and Annihilated! It lives no longer in it ſelf; becauſe God lives in it: And now it may moſt truly be ſaid of it, that it is a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phaenix; becauſe 'tis Changed, Spiritualized, Transformed, and Deified.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="196">196. THe way to attain that high ſtate of a Mind reformed, whereby a man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gets to the greateſt good, to our firſt original, and to the higheſt peace, is his Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Endeavour, O Soul, to be always buried in that miſery. This nothing, and this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged miſery, is the means by which the Lord works wonders in thy Soul. Cloath thy ſelf with this nothing, and with this miſery, and ſee that this miſery and this nothing be thy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al food and habitation, even to the caſting down thy ſelf low therein; and then I aſſure thee, that thou being in that manner, the Nothing, the Lord will be the Whole in thy Soul.</p>
                     <p n="197">197. Why, thinkeſt thou, do infinite Souls hinder the abundant current of the Divine gifts? 'Tis onely becauſe they would be doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and have a deſire to be great: all this is to come away from Internal Humility, and from their own Nothing; and therefore they prevent thoſe wonders which that infinite goodneſs would work in 'em: They betake themſelves to the very gifts of the Spirit, and there they ſtick, that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:179937:111"/>they may come out from the Center of Nothing, and ſo the whole Work is ſpoil'd. They ſeek not God with truth, and therefore they find him not: For know thou muſt, that there is no finding of Him, but in the undervaluing of our own ſelves, and in nothing.</p>
                     <p n="198">198. We ſeek our ſelves, every time we get out of our Nothing; and therefore we never get to quiet and perfect Contemplation. Creep in as far as ever thou canſt into the truth of thy Nothing, and then nothing will diſquiet thee: Nay, thou wilt be humble and aſhamed, loſing openly thy own reputation and eſteem.</p>
                     <p n="199">199. O what a ſtrong Bulwark wilt thou find of that Nothing! who can ever afflict thee, if once thou doſt retire into that Fortreſs? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul which is deſpiſed by it ſelf, and in its own knowledge is Nothing, is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving Grievance or Injury from any Body. The Soul which keeps within its No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is internally Silent, lives reſign'd in any torment whatſoever, by thinking it leſs than what it doth deſerve: It ſhuns the ſuſpition of a Neighbour, never looks at other folks faults, but its own is free from abundance of Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and becomes Commander of great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Whilſt the Soul keeps ſtill and quiet in its nothing, it perfects it, it enriches it, the Lord draws his own Image and likeneſs in it, without any thing to hinder it.</p>
                     <p n="200">200. By the way of <hi>Nothing</hi> thou muſt come to loſe thy ſelf in God, (which is the laſt degree of perfection) and happy wilt thou be,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:179937:111"/>if thou canſt ſo loſe thy ſelf; then thou wilt get thy ſelf again, and find thy ſelf moſt certainly. In this ſame ſhop of <hi>Nothing,</hi> Simplicity is made; interior and infuſed recollection is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; quiet is obtained, and the heart is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all manner of imperfection. O what a Treaſure wilt thou find, if thou ſhalt once fix thy habitation in <hi>Nothing!</hi> and if thou once getteſt but ſnugg into the center of <hi>Nothing,</hi> thou wilt never concern thy ſelf with any thing that is without, (the great ugly large ſtep that ſo many thouſand Souls do ſtumble at) unleſs it be as thy office may call thee to it.</p>
                     <p n="201">201. If thou doſt but get ſhut up in <hi>Nothing,</hi> (where the blows of adverſity can never come) nothing will vex thee or break thy peace: This is the way of getting to the command of thy ſelf: becauſe perfect and true dominion doth only govern in <hi>Nothing:</hi> with the Helmet of <hi>Nothing</hi> thou wilt be too hard for ſtrong temptations and the terrible ſuggeſtions of the envious Enemy. [I defie all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to match this incomparable piece of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Enthuſiaſtick Cant.]</p>
                     <p n="202">202. Knowing that thou art nothing, that thou canſt do nothing and art worth juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, thou wilt quietly embrace paſſive dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; thou wilt endure horrible deſolations; thou wilt undergo ſpiritual martyrdoms and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward torments. By means of this <hi>Nothing</hi> thou muſt die in thy ſelf, many ways, at all times, and all hours.</p>
                     <p n="203">203. Who muſt awaken the Soul out of that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:179937:112"/>ſweet and pleaſant ſleep, if once it comes to take a nap in <hi>Nothing?</hi> This is the way that <hi>David</hi> got to perfect annihilation, without ſo much as knowing it. <hi>Ad nihilum redactus ſum &amp; neſcivi,</hi> Pſal. 17. Keeping thy ſelf in <hi>nothing,</hi> thou wilt bar the door againſt every thing that is not God; thou wilt retire alſo from thine own ſelf and walk towards that internal ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, where the divine Spouſe ſpeaks in the heart of his Bride, teaching her high and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom. Drown thy ſelf in this <hi>Nothing,</hi> and there ſhalt thou find a holy Sanctuary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Tempeſt whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="204">204. By this way muſt thou return to the happy ſtate of Innocence forfeited by our firſt parents. By this gate thou muſt enter into the happy land of the living, where thou wilt find the greateſt good, the breadth of charity, the beauty of righteouſneſs, the ſtreight line of Equity and Juſtice, and, in ſum every jot and tittle of Perfection. Laſtly, do not look at <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> deſire <hi>nothing,</hi> will <hi>nothing,</hi> nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>nothing,</hi> and then in every thing thy Soul will live repos'd, with quiet and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="205">205. This is the way to get purity of Soul, perfect contemplation and peace internal: walk therefore in this ſafe path and endeavour to overwhelm thy ſelf in this <hi>Nothing,</hi> endeavour to loſe thy ſelf, to ſink deep into it, if thou haſt a mind to be annihilated, united and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="206">206. THe Soul being once annihilated and renewed with perfect nakedneſs, finds in its ſuperiour part a profound peace, and a ſweet reſt, which brings it to ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect union of love, that 'tis joyful all over. And ſuch a Soul as this, is already arrived to ſuch a happineſs, that it neither wills nor deſires any thing but what its Beloved wills; it conforms it ſelf to this Will in all emergencies, as well of comfort as anguiſh, and rejoyces alſo in every thing to do the Divine Good pleaſure.</p>
                     <p n="207">207. There is nothing but what comforts it; nor doth it want any thing, but what it can well want: To dye, is enjoyment to it; and to live, is its joy. It is as contented here upon Earth as it can be in Paradiſe; it is as glad under privation, as it can be in poſſeſſion; in ſickneſs as it can be in health; becauſe it knows that this is the will of its Lord. This is its life, this its glory, its paradiſe, its peace, its repoſe, its reſt, its conſolation and higheſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                     <p n="208">208. If it were neceſſary to ſuch a Soul as this, which is gotten up by the ſteps of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:179937:113"/>to the region of peace, to make its choice, it would chuſe deſolation before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; contempt before honour; becauſe the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jeſus made great eſteem of reproach and pain: if it firſt endured the hunger of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Heaven, if it thirſted for God, if it had the fear of loſing him; the lamentation of heart, and the fighting of the devil; now things are altered and hunger is turned into ſatisfying, the thirſt into ſatiety, the fear into aſſurance, the ſadneſs into joy, the weeping into merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the fierce fighting into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt peace. O happy Soul, that enjoys here on earth ſo great a felicity! Thou muſt know, that theſe kind of Souls (though few they are) be the ſtrong Pillars which ſupport the Church, and ſuch as abate the divine indignation.</p>
                     <p n="209">209. And now this Soul that is entered into the heaven of peace, acknowledges it ſelf full of God and his ſupernatural gifts, becauſe it lives grounded in a pure love, receiving equal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in light and darkneſs, in night and day, in affliction and conſolation. Through this holy and heavenly indifference, it never loſes its peace in adverſity, nor its tranquility in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, but ſees it ſelf full of unſpeakable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</p>
                     <p n="210">210. And although the Prince of Darkneſs makes all the aſſaults of Hell againſt it, with horrible temptations, yet it makes head againſt 'em, and ſtands like a ſtrong Pillar; no more happening to it by 'em, than happens to a high mountain and a deep valley in the time of ſtorm and tempeſt.</p>

The ſame happens to this bleſſed ſoul: the valley of the part below is ſuffering tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions combats, darkneſs, deſolations, torments, martyrdoms and ſuggeſtions; and at the ſame time, on the lofty mountain of the higher part of the ſoul, the true ſun caſts its beams; it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames and enlightens it; and ſo it becomes clear, peaceable, reſplendent, quiet, ſerene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meer ocean of joy.</p>
                     <p n="213">213. So great therefore is the quiet of this pure foul, which is gotten up the mountain of tranquility, ſo great is the peace of its ſpirit, ſo great the ſerenity and chearfulneſs that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that a remnant and glimmering of God do redound even to the outſide of it.</p>
                     <p n="214">214. Becauſe in the throne of quiet are manifeſt the perfections of ſpiritual beauty; here the true light of the ſecret and divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our holy faith, here perfect humility, even to the annihilation of it ſelf, the ampleſt reſignation, chaſtity, poverty of ſpirit, the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and innocence of the Dove, external mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, ſilence and internal ſolitude, liberty and purity of heart; here the forgetfulneſs of every created thing, even of it ſelf, joyful ſimplicity, heavenly indifference, continual Prayer, a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:179937:114"/>nakedneſs, perfect diſintereſtedneſs, a moſt wiſe contemplation, a converſation of heaven; and laſtly, the moſt perfect and ſerene peace within, of which this happy ſoul may ſay what the wiſe man ſaid of wiſdom, that all other graces came along in company with her. <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt mihi omnia bona paritur cum illa,</hi> Wiſd. 7.11.</p>
                     <p n="215">215. This is the rich and hidden treaſure, this the loſt groat of the Goſpel; this is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life, the happy life, the true life, and the bleſſedneſs here below. O thou lovely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that paſſeſt the knowledge of the ſons of men! O excellent ſupernatural life, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and unſpeakable art thou, for thou art the very draught of bleſſedneſs!

We all live in miſtakes, ſeeking the fooliſh world and forſaking thee, who art our God. We all forſake thee, the Fountain of Living Waters, for the ſtinking dirt of the world.</p>

O Divine Lord! what a few Souls are there in the world, which do ſerve thee with perfection! how ſmall is the number of thoſe, who are willing to ſuffer, that they may follow Chriſt crucified, that they may embrace the Croſs, that they may deny and contemn themſelves! O what a ſcarcity of Souls is there, which are diſintereſted and totally naked! how few are thoſe Souls which are dead to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and alive to God, which are totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to his divine good pleaſure! how few thoſe, who are adorn'd with ſimple obedience, profound knowledge of themſelves and true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility! How few thoſe, which with an intire indifference give up themſelves into the hands of God, to do what he pleaſes with 'em! how few are there of thoſe pure Souls which be of a ſimple and diſintereſted heart, and which, putting off their own underſtanding, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, deſire and will, do long for ſelf-denial and ſpiritual death! O what a ſcarcity of Souls is there which are willing to let the Divine Creator work in 'em a mind to ſuffer, that they may not ſuffer, and to die, that they may not die! How few are the Souls which are willing to forget themſelves, to free their hearts from their own affections, their own deſires, their own ſatisfactions, their own love and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! that are willing to be lead by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſelf-denial and the internal way! that are willing to be annihilated, dying to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſenſes! that are willing to let themſelves be emptied, purified and uncloathed,

                  <p>THE following Treatiſe was approved of at <hi>Rome</hi> by Fryer <hi>Peter Damian,</hi> a Diſcalceate Carmelite, Viſitor General and Reader of Theology in the Convent of S. <hi>Mary della Scala,</hi> in the Year <hi>1675,</hi> when the foregoing Book was ſo highly applauded and ſet out with ſo many Formallities: And after him, <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Martinez,</hi> a Jeſuite, Chief Reader of Theology in the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge, (which is one of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest Offices in one of the most eminent Houſes of Education in the whole City) comes to ſet his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to it: And then, after theſe two, our old Friend, that we were beholden to before, Fryer <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> of the most Holy Trinity, Qualifier of the Holy Office in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. he tells us, that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he found nothing in it contrary to Faith or good Manners, or repugnant to the Reverence due to the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he takes it to be worthy to be Printed for divers and ſundry reaſons. So that though it met not with thoſe Acclamations which the former Book did, (the reaſons whereof you will preſently ſmell out, when you read it) yet theſe three Teſtimonies (beſides the pains that that
<pb facs="tcp:179937:121"/>devout Priest (as he calls himſelf) took to get it out of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> into <hi>Italian</hi>) were enough to give it Credit and Authority in the World: And as it came tack't to t'other Book ſo 'twas pity to make it part Company.</p>
                  <p>But whilst theſe Reverend Gentlemen have been ſo kind to help it into the World, and ſpeak ſuch good things of it, 'tis plain that they either wink't at, or did not know one groſs Contradiction that it makes to the foregoing Book; and that is this: That this <hi>Mich. Molinos</hi> does lay it down as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiple, in his <hi>Spiritual Guide,</hi> That the Penitent ought to reſign up his Will, his Judgment, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, his Choice to the determination of his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Director. And produces Examples for it, and tells him, that he must be led blindfold by his Confeſſor, though he ſhould put him upon never ſo uſeleſs and nonſenſical Penance and Mortification, as planting Lettice with the Roots upwards, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> (a ſpecimen of which ſort of aſinvne and und ſputing Obedience is to be ſeen preſſed by the Founder of the Jeſuitical Order, in his Epiſtle to the Brethren of his Society, <hi>Reg. Soc. Jeſu,</hi> Cap. <hi>18.</hi> wherein he inſtances in Abbot <hi>John,</hi> that watered a withered Tree for a whole Year together: (Which did him as much good as if he had tied a Whiting to his Girdle.) And, at his Superiour's command, tried to move a vast Stone which was beyond the ſtrength of many men together to do; (which he had no more reaſon to do, than to knock his Head against it). And the reaſon that is given for this ſort of affected and fooliſh Humility, forſooth, must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Father Confeſſor is in God's place, and
<pb facs="tcp:179937:121"/>whatever he enjoyns his Penitent, must be done by an abſolute and unlimited Obedience, without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, why or wherefore, or entring into any thoughts of the reaſonableneſs or unreaſonableneſs, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or inconvenience, good or hurt of ſuch a rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſort of Diſcipline: And what fine work may there be ſometimes done, when a ſilly Priest meets with a Penitent that is as wiſe as himſelf? But if the buſineſs be really thus, then what's the reaſon that this Author doth ſo often in this Treatiſe, flie in the face of the Miniſters, (who, in his ſenſe, are theſe Confeſſors) and tax them with I know not what, and make most lamentable out-cries against 'em for hindring their Penitents from Daily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? This is going backward and forward, ſaying and unſaying again: For if the Confeſſor have a power of diſpoſing of his Penitent's (I was going to ſay Client's) Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he pleaſes, and an unaccountable Empire and Government over him; I would fain ſee how he can adviſe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs? And why ſhould all this noiſe be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst theſe Miniſters who are made Judges of the diſpoſition of their People, whom they Shrine, and therefore are preſumed to do no more than what there is reaſon for, in hindring 'em from Daily Communion?</p>
                  <p>If the foregoing Book were first Penn'd by the Author, then he either retracted his judgment, in this Treatiſe, or elſe forgot himſelf, (which he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes often as a Duty of Religion.) If this Treatiſe was Penn'd first, then the Author was willing to give Confeſſors more ſcope and power in [his <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guide]</hi> than he thought fit to allow 'em in his
<pb facs="tcp:179937:122"/>
                     <hi>[Daily Communion.]</hi> However the matter was, there is a filthy Miſtake ſome where or other; to preſs blind Obedience to Confeſſors in one Book, and yet bawl at 'em for requiring it in another. The least that can be ſaid of it, is, that 'tis an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an inconſtant or forgetful Head. And I leave it to him to make it out, or to any body elſe that has a mind to clear the point. The Treatiſe it ſelf is like other Popiſh Treatiſes upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; onely 'tis a queſtion, whether the Author be ſo far Annihilated yet (as his word is) as to believe Tranſubſtantiation ſo ſtoutly as others of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion would make us believe they do. He hath been mightily converſant in Modern Caſuiſts and Schoolmen, and that makes him ſo ill a Divine, as to tell us of receiving good by the Sacrament <hi>ex opere operate; i. e.</hi> Never minding what is done, but only the doing the bare action of it.

I confeſs they are very pregnant for his purpoſe, if he can but ſhew us thoſe Words in the true Writings of thoſe two Fathers: but to ſend us to the Man in the Moon to know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is not fair nor Scholar-like.

<pb facs="tcp:179937:123"/>to their own Senſe and Judgment. This Compendium of the Reaſons and Authorities of Councils, Saints, and Doctors, is onely drawn up a-purpoſe, that Confeſſours may ſee the ſmall reaſon there is to hinder thoſe Souls from taking the Communion, which deſire it, receive good by it, and are obedient to their Directions.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>No Miniſter ought to keep a faithful Perſon from the Communion, that does deſire and ask it, whilst he doth not know his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience defiled with mortal Sin.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> treating of the Preparation which Prieſts and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to make for the worthy Receiving of the Holy Euchariſt, hath theſe following words, (<hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Cap.</hi> 17.) The Cuſtom of the Church makes it clear, that Examination and Proof is neceſſary in order to the Communion; that no man, knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf guilty of mortal Sin, though he may ſeem
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179937:124"/>Contrite to himſelf, come to the Sacrament, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have before been at Sacramental Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Which comprehends all Chriſtians, and even Prieſts, who are bound by their Office to Celebrate it: from whence 'tis clearly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that the Council makes no other diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary for the Communicating of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the Prieſt's ſaying Maſs, than not to have any mortal Sin. Why then ſhould the Miniſters be a hindrance to thoſe which have that diſpoſition?</p>
                     <p>The Miniſters will not ſay that their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is greater than that of the Council; nor that they are more Learned than all thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church that came to it; nor will they ſay, leſs, that they have a greater light from God, than that which he then communicated to his Spouſe, the Church: Therefore the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought not to require a greater diſpoſition, than being without mortal Sin, whilſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil requires no more.</p>
                     <p>Either the Miniſters and Prieſts, which ſay Maſs daily, have this Holineſs and Perfection themſelves, which they require in Laymen, or elſe they have it not: they will not ſay they have it, becauſe it would then be pride in 'em: If they have it not, and yet Celebrate Maſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, why do they require it from Laymen, in order to the granting 'em the Communion daily? 'Tis good to adviſe 'em to this Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but if they ſhould not have it, it will not be reaſonable to deprive 'em of ſo great a good, becauſe they may have reaſon to fear that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179937:124"/>Chriſt our Lord may ſay to 'em as he did to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> (St <hi>Matthew</hi> 23.24.) That they bind heavy burdens upon men, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will not touch 'em with one of their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: And that alſo is verified which <hi>David</hi> ſaid, (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 61.10.) That men are deceitful in the weight. <hi>Mendaces filii hominum in ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris:</hi> Since they have one weight for themſelves and another for Laymen.</p>
                     <p>If the Council judges that not being in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin, is a worthy diſpoſition towards ſaying Maſs daily, conſecrating and offering Sacrifice, which is the holieſt Service, how much more worthy will ſuch a diſpoſition be for onely the receiving the Communion?</p>
                     <p>If Councils, the Church, Popes, Saints, and Doctors require no greater diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fruit from this Sacrament, than not being in mortal Sin, why muſt the Miniſters require a greater?</p>
                     <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath the following words: (Seſſ. 28. Cap. 6.) <hi>Optaret quidem San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Synodus ut in ſingulis miſſis fideles adſtantes, non ſolum ſpirituali affectu, ſed Sacramentali eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Euchariſtiae perceptione Communicarent, quo ad eos hujus ſacrificii fructus uberior perveniret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> That is, the holy Council would look upon it as a very good thing that in every days Maſs, the Faithful, who aſſiſt at it, would be Communicated, not onely Spiritually and in their deſires, but alſo Sacramentally, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Holy Euchariſt, that they might thus obtain the more abundant benefit by this moſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179937:125"/>Holy Sacrament. The Council therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that the Faithful would Communicate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day that they hear Maſs, with the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having no mortal Sin, as it ſignified <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. Will any Miniſters ſay, that this is not well; and ſo openly ſet themſelves in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the deſires of the Church?</p>
                     <p>The Congregation of the Council declared it an Errour that any Biſhops in a Capriccio ſhould limit and hinder Daily Communion from being taken by Merchants and Houſe-keepers: The holy <hi>Rota</hi> reports it in the year 1587, <hi>(Barboſ. in Concil. Trid. Sup. c.</hi> 22.) and after it had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that all Laymen might be communicated, even every day, though they ſhould be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Houſe-keepers, it adds the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words: —<hi>Quapropter exhortandi ſunt fideles, ut ſicut quotidie peccant, ita quotidie medicinam accipiant:</hi> That is, wherefore the Faithful are to be exhorted, that as they Sin daily, ſo they daily receive this Medicine of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. And the ſame Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſays, (Seſſ. 13. c. 2. de Inſtit. Sanctiſſ. Sacr.) <hi>Qui manducat me, ipſe vivet propter me, &amp; tanquam antidotum, quo liberemur a culpis quotidianis &amp; a peccatis mortalibus praeſervemur:</hi> —The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is as an Antidote to free us from daily Sins, and preſerve us from mortal Sins. If the Council and its Decree ſpeaks here, not of the <hi>Baſils</hi> and <hi>Antonies,</hi> nor of the <hi>Catharines</hi> and <hi>Clares,</hi> as ſome ſay it is required for 'em to be, but of thoſe that Sin daily; why ſhould they be kept from the Medicine, that they may not Sin?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:179937:125"/>The Council of <hi>Milan</hi> (3 <hi>de Euch.</hi>) and that of <hi>Cabilon (Cant.</hi> 46.) are of the ſame mind.</p>
                     <p>The bleſſed <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> ſays, (Catech. Rom. 2. p. c. 4. §. 60.) The Curates are bound to exhort the Faithful often, that as they hold it neceſſary to feed the Body daily, ſo they hold it alſo neceſſary to feed the Soul as often with this Sacrament: becauſe the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did eat <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderneſs daily; and that <hi>Manna</hi> was the Figure of this ſacred Food: And that ſentence [Thou ſinneſt every day, be communicated alſo every day] is not onely St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, but the ſaying of all the Saints.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Biſhop and Martyr, <hi>(Epiſt. ad Eph.)</hi> exhorts that we often come and receive the Euchariſt; becauſe the frequency of it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the power of Satan. The Council of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſays, (<hi>De Euch. c.</hi> 5.) That without this frequency, it will be a hard matter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Grace. St. <hi>John Chriſoſtome (In Epiſt. S. Paul ad Tim.)</hi> ſays, It is no raſhneſs for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to come often to the Sacrament: he that remembers not a great fault of himſelf, may come to it every day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theophylact (In Prim. S. Paul ad Corinth.</hi> 11.) ſays, To know whether thou mayeſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, be thou the Judge, and having examined thy ſelf, thou mayeſt do it, without ſtaying for a Feſtival, unleſs thou findeſt thy ſelf burthened with a great fault.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Cyprian (In Orat. Dom. Serm.</hi> 6.) ſays, Let us ask this daily Bread, being in no great fault,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179937:126"/>let us receive this Bread every day, which gives us Life Eternal; and let us beg that our Bread, which is Chriſt our Lord, may be daily given us, to keep us in his Grace: No ſmall loſs it is, to forbear Communicating every day.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Hilary</hi> ſays, (<hi>De Conſecrat. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 51.) If thy Sins are not ſo grievous as to deſerve Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, not being mortal, if they ſhould be mortal, after Confeſſion, as <hi>Suarez</hi> expounds it, <hi>Diſp.</hi> 60. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 3.) never keep off from the daily Medicine, which is the Body and Blood of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays, (5 <hi>de Sacram. c.</hi> 4.) Receive daily, that which is to help thee daily: he that does not deſerve to receive it every day, doth not deſerve to receive it in a whole year: Sins are daily committed, and therefore this Divine Bread is for every day. Thou offendeſt every day, waſh thy ſelf therefore of thy Sin every day in the Fountain of Repentance; and if thou comeſt every day to this Divine Sacrament, thou wilt find wholeſome Medicine, and not the Poiſon of Judgment.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays, <hi>(In Apol. Cont. Jovin.)</hi> We ſhould always receive the Holy Euchariſt, that we may be without mortal Sin: And in his time, which was the Year 470, he ſays, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cuſtom of Communicating every day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, <hi>(Tract. 26. in Johan.)</hi> If thou comeſt without Sin, come and welcome; 'tis Bread and not Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>Again, (<hi>Ep. de verb. Dom. Ser.</hi> 28.) 'Tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179937:126"/>to Communicate for Devotion, than let it alone for Reverence. And in another place, This is the daily Bread, receive it daily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will daily do thee good, and thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt receive it every day.</p>
                     <p>Some aſcribe that ſentence to the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Quotidie Euchariſtiae Communionem percipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, nec laudo nec reprehendo.</hi> With which a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop reproved S. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> becauſe ſhe took the Sacrament every day: and the Saint replied to him, How he durſt reprove in her, that which St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> durſt not reprove? <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> therefore (<hi>De Script. Eccleſ.</hi> in the Year 420.) ſays that this ſentence is not St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s, but <hi>Gennadius</hi>'s of <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> and ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors aſſure us.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Gregory</hi> (<hi>De Conſeor. d.</hi> 2. <hi>c. Quid ſit San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis.</hi>) ſays, The Lord gave us this Salutary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to pardon our daily Sins; let us receive it every day.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Bernard (In Serm. de Caena Dom.)</hi> ſays, The wounded man ſeeks Medicine: we are all of us wounded, when we have Sinned; our Medicine is the Divine Sacrament: receive it daily and thou wilt recover daily.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Apollonius (In vitis Patrum, ejus vita.)</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed his Monks to be communicated every day, that they might be preſerved in Grace.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> (<hi>De Praecept. Relig. Proceſ.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 21.) Though thou ſhouldſt find thy ſelf luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, with little Fervour in thee, yet, truſting in the Mercy of God, thou mayeſt ſafely come to the Communion: if thou think'ſt thy ſelf
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179937:127"/>unworthy, (ſo that thou remembreſt no mortal Sin of thine own) come; becauſe the weaker thou art, the greater need haſt thou of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian. Thou do'ſt not receive Chriſt to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Him, but that he may ſanctify thee.</p>
                     <p>The Council of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (<hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char.</hi>) ſays, Without this frequency, 'tis hard to keep in Grace.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Antony</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> (<hi>Par.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. §. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.) ſays, Thoſe that live well muſt be ſure to be adviſed to receive this moſt holy Sacrament frequently; becauſe as long abſtinence from bodily Food, weakens the Body, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſes it for Death, ſo the much abſtaining from this ſpiritual Food, weakens the Soul, ſpends the fervour, and by degrees inclines it to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> (<hi>In</hi> 4 <hi>Sent. Tract. de Euchar.</hi>) ſays, When once the preparation is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Humane frailty, 'tis ſafer to receive than keep from the moſt Holy Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> (3 <hi>Par. quaeſt.</hi> 80. <hi>art.</hi> 10.) asks, If it be lawful to Communicate every day? And anſwers with St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> This is daily Bread: receive it every day, that thou mayeſt every day be profited by it.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccleſ. Offic.</hi>) hath this, Some ſay, that if there be no Sin, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ought to be taken daily; and they ſay well, if they receive it with Veneration and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Anaclete,</hi> Pope, (<hi>De Conſcer. diſt.</hi> 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>ca. Peracta.</hi>) perceiving Daily Communion grow
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179937:127"/>into diſuſe, brought it up again, ordering, that after Conſecration all thoſe that were preſent ſhould be communicated, becauſe this Cuſtom (as he ſays in a Decree of his) was eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles and kept by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: and thoſe that did not communicate, were turn'd out of the Church.</p>

                        <hi>Henriquez</hi> relates it, (<hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Euchar. cap.</hi> 88. <hi>n.</hi> 2.) that St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> do commend thoſe who communicate daily, without ſin. Thoſe that the Confeſſor ſhall judge worthy of abſolution, may be adviſed by him to receive the Communion, though they fear an eaſie relaps. 'Tis not neceſſary to make an experiment of frequent Communion from a man's good and profit by it: becauſe ſpiritual profit (which is inſenſible) is much leſs found than corporal profit.</p>

                     <p>Finally, the illuminate <hi>Thauler</hi> ſays, that to receive the moſt holy Sacrament without mortal ſin, as has been ſaid, does more good than to hear a hundred Maſſes, or a hundred Sermons: and ſo ſay many Authors, as <hi>Jerom Perez</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>(inſum. Theolog. de Euch.)</hi> that he that does but once receive the moſt holy Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mortal ſin, gets more grace by it, than if he ſhould go thrice in Pilgrimage to the holy Sepulcher at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and that never did any body communicate, without obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grace thereby, and a ſingular degree of Charity which he had not before, though he were never ſo lukewarm and dry.</p>
                     <p>A grave religious man adds this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That if all the Charity ſhould be put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which all men have had or ſhall have, which have been, are or ſhall be, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of 'em all, and the praiſes that have been given and ſhall be given, and all the good works which have been done and ſhall be done, and the torments of Martyrs, the Faſtings, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179937:129"/>and Hair-cloaths of all the Saints, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, Patriarchs, Virgins and Prophets, with whatever elſe that ſhall be done as long as the World indures; put it all together, and it doth not pleaſe God ſo much, as the receiving of this Divine Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Others ſay, as the aboveſaid Author relates, that if all the Quires of Angels, all the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Heaven, and the moſt holy Virgin (Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs of 'em all, who incomparably exceed 'em all) ſhould meet together, it is not in their power to do a more pleaſing Sacrifice to God, nor a more acceptable Offering, than Saying of Maſs, or, when men communicate, to offer to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that Divine Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Cyril</hi> (in <hi>S. Johan. c.</hi> 37. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 17.) affirms, that the only delaying of it never creates a better diſpoſition to it; and it commonly happens, that thoſe who are ſloweſt to come to the Communion, come leſs prepared: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe following Reaſons do make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. To communicate worthily without mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin is good of it ſelf; to forbear it, is not ſo: To go often to the Sacrament is a product of Charity; to delay it, comes from negligence or fear: better is the work of Charity than that of Fear. He that communicates gets the better of him that lets it alone in the good he receives by the Sacrament <hi>Ex opere operato:</hi> and at the moſt may eaſily be equal to him, ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of communicating worthily, is no leſs good, than keeping from it out of reverence. If it be ſometimes good to abſtain, it ought to be for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179937:130"/>the obtaining or preſerving the reverence and devotion of it: and for this reaſon the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the moſt holy Sacrament is not of leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſince thereby the Soul gets cleanſed of thoſe evil habits and affections and natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that we have.</p>
                     <p>If the Scripture therefore in many places, if the Apoſtles, Councils, Popes, all the Saints and Doctors do adviſe us to daily communion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation or laxing, and if there be no Law divine or humane to forbid it to him that has no mortal ſin to hinder him, what is the reaſon that the Miniſters ſhould forbid or limit that which neither Chriſt nor the Church nor any Law does limit? 'Twill be prudence therefore not to oppoſe the Sayings of Doctors, Saints, Popes and Councils, to get free from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to many Miniſters for forbidding of it.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Bernardino</hi> of <hi>Villegas,</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Lutgard,</hi> chap. 25. ſays, that among other perſons that thought ill of the frequent commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Saint, the Abbeſs was one, who being led by an indiſcreet zeal, ordered her not to communicate ſo often: to whom the humble Virgin return'd this Anſwer, with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That ſhe was ready and prepared to obey her order with content, but ſhe knew for certain, that this disfavour ſhe did her would diſpleaſe Jeſus Chriſt, and that in the puniſhment which would follow, ſhe would quickly underſtand how ill ſhe did, in depriving her of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. The Saint obeyed, and in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179937:130"/>of her obedience, it ſeems, the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good the Voice of her Prophecy, ſent the Abbeſs a great fit of ſickneſs, which afflicted her much with continual and ſharp pains, till ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging her fault, and that this chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befel her for her indiſcreet zeal uſed to the Saint, ſhe ſent for her and gave her leave to follow her holy cuſtom, and ſo the fault end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the puniſhment ended alſo, and the diſeaſe which had brought her to a very ſad condition. Other perſons alſo who in like manner uſed to keep a pother with the Saint about her often Communions, repenting of what they had done, askt her pardon. And other of their complices in their prate and goſſippings, becauſe they never laid to heart what they had ſaid of her, were puniſhed of God with a ſudden death.</p>
                     <p>In the third Book of St. <hi>Gertrudes</hi> Life, <hi>chap.</hi> 23. 'tis told, that a certain Preacher or Confeſſor, being a little warm'd with the zeal of God's Honour, took a pet at ſome religious Women, thinking that they were often commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated: At this the Saint made a Prayer, and askt the Lord, Whether this were acceptable to him, or no? The Lord made her this anſwer; It being my delight to be with the children of men, and I having, of infinite love, left this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be often received in remembrance of me, and being in it to the faithful to the World's end, whoſoever ſhall, with words or other ways of perſwaſion, to go about to hinder any from taking it, who are free from mortal ſin, doth in a certain manner hinder me, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179937:131"/>rob me of my pleaſure and delight, which I might have with 'em. Some Miniſters there are who have had a mind to reſtrain this matter too much; as if the Sacrament were not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Laymen, or as if they had no right to ask it as often as they are diſpoſed to receive it. O, as if Chriſt our Lord had inſtituted it with a limitation or precept, that it ſhould not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but by ſuch and ſuch men, and on ſuch and ſuch days.</p>
                     <p>Expert Teachers do ſtrangely wonder to ſee the ſcruple and cautiouſneſs, with which ſome Confeſſors ſpeak about this matter, as if the Communion were a very dangerous thing for Souls, or through the too much frequenting of it, the Honour of God or the Vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments muſt needs be loſt or leſſened: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the frequency of it is the very remedy and health of Souls and the work in which there is the greateſt honour done to God and which they ought moſt to endeavour, who deſire his glory.</p>
                     <p>And if the Miniſter ſhould at any time find himſelf diſſatisfied at this, let him peruſe that holy Appointment of the Church, (<hi>De Conſecr. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Aug. in Pſ.</hi> 48.) <hi>Non prohibeat diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſator manducare pingues terrae in menſa Domini.</hi> And if the diſpenſer himſelf cannot hinder this, much leſs can they hinder it, who have nothing to do to diſpenſe it: and if this which has been ſaid is notenough, let him be afraid of thoſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Puniſhments which God has uſed upon thoſe Miniſters which have forbid it.</p>

                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:179937:131"/>But for all this, the Communion ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be uſed at the ſpiritual Father's order, who neither ought to hinder nor delay it, when he knows the Soul, that deſires it and reaps good of it, to be ſo diſpoſed as the Council requires. And if another Confeſſor ſhould order him the quite contrary, let him follow the judgment of that ghoſtly Father, who knows better than any other, how his Conſcience is, and by whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel he goes and acts ſafely.</p>

                     <p>EIther the Communion muſt be forbidden to thoſe that ask it and deſire it without the guilt of Mortal Sin, becauſe they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, or for the greater reverence of it, or, becauſe much Familiarity breeds Contempt, or elſe for Mortification and Penance: The firſt reaſon, of not being worthy, is not ſufficient; becauſe if they make a Chriſtian forbear, till he be worthy of the Communion, then he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive it: becauſe no man is worthy to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179937:132"/>receive Chriſt, no not Heaven it ſelf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many holy men ſay, that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion taken to day is a diſpoſition for that to morrow.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, that Councils, the Saints and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do aſſure us, that not being in Mortal Sin, is that neceſſary worthineſs and diſpoſition which is required for the Communion; we are not to go to it, as worthy, but as having need of it: we do not go to ſanctifie Jeſus Chriſt, but to be ſanctified and healed by him, by the means of the Sacrament, as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us, — <hi>I who do continually ſin, ought continually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Medicine of this Sacrament against the peſtilent Diſeaſe of Sin.</hi> (Ep. 208.)</p>
                     <p>Nor may a Chriſtian be debarr'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for the ſecond reaſon, of greater reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, becauſe 'tis contrary to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who ſays, (<hi>Ep.</hi> 26. <hi>de verb. Dom. Serm.</hi> 28.) that 'tis better to communicate through Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than let it alone through Reverence. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Carthuſianus</hi> ſays the ſame thing, 'Tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to communicate through Love, than abſtain from it through Humility and Fear. (<hi>De Euch. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6.) There is not more devotion, love and reſpect ſhewed to God by leſs frequent coming to the Sacrament: but rather he loves and fears God moſt, who, without mortal ſin, and with a deſire of his own ſpiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, comes every day to it: and the delaying of it is not a greater diſpoſedneſs nor veneration, but a manifeſt temptation.</p>
                     <p>By keeping away, they think to find better
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:179937:132"/>devotion and fervour, and in the mean time they are dry, luke-warm and cold, as we ſee by experience. Theſe people that will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unleſs they be ſenſibly and actually devout, are like thoſe who are cold, who will not come near the fire, till they are warm; or like thoſe ſick men that will not ask the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians counſel, till they are grown well. Chriſt's Body is like a ſpiritual fire, let us approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and it will warm us. The fleſh of Chriſt, ſays <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> is a live coal, which heats and burns.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon which ſome give for the hindring Chriſtians the Communion, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ask it, is a certain whimſey or <hi>capriccio</hi> which they imprint in their minds, telling 'em, that to go frequently to the Sacrament is too much familiarity, and that this breeds contempt. <hi>Nimia familiaritas parit contemptum.</hi> O hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deceit! O pernicious Doctrine! though taught by the Miniſters with no bad zeal. Is it poſſible, that, among ſo many Saints and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church which have written pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly upon this Point, as is manifeſt by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, none of 'em ſhould light upon the reaſon, that theſe Miniſters talk of? 'Tis well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred therefore, that 'tis of ſmall conſideration and account.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that too much familiarity is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the occaſion of contempt: but of what, and to whom? The too much familiarity with a vile thing, occaſions contempt, but how can familiar converſation with a thing that is grave,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179937:133"/>good, and amiable, how can this cauſe contempt? In earthly things familiarity begets contempt; becauſe the more one man gets acquainted and intimate with another, he diſcovers his defects by degrees, and ſo values him leſs than he did at firſt. But with God the thing is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: becauſe as the creature proceeds in the knowledge of that fountain of true perfection, by the ſame meaſure the love and eſteem of that great Lord grows more.</p>
                     <p>If by communicating daily there could be any defect diſcovered in Jeſus Chriſt, certain it is, that this frequency and familiarity would breed contempt of him; but the more that boundleſs ocean of perfection is received, the more is his goodneſs known, and the greater doth the love, the reſpect and the reverence to him grow. And if it were true, that too much frequency occaſioned contempt, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give laws to God himſelf, and take care not to render himſelf ſo eaſie and familiar to the Saints and Angels of Heaven, with whom he hath ſo great and continual an intimacy. Who is more familiar with God than the Angels who continually behold his divine countenance? and what, doth this make 'em leave off honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reverencing and loving him?</p>
                     <p>But they will ſay, it is not good to abuſe this familiarity and intimacy with God. What a blindneſs is this! what ſhould the meaning of this be, unleſs they would not have us ſo united with God, and have a mind that we ſhould ſerve him at a diſtance, and not near, and more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:179937:133"/>by name than affection. Theſe words ariſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the little will they have that we ſhould receive this divine Lord, than from the reſpect of not diſpleaſing him: if they had true charity, and did but heartily love Jeſus Chriſt, they would deſpiſe all fear, and not remove us from the frequency of this divine Sacrament; nay, they would deſire and prompt us on to receive him daily, that we might be united unto God.</p>
                     <p>If they know, that Chriſt deſires to be united with us, why ſhould they be unwilling that we ſhould be united with him, our great Lord; fearing where no fear is? if they ſee that an infinite God deſires our familiarity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, what is it that they build upon, to hinder us from being his friends? do they think that by this continual frequency that will be tedious to us, without which every thing elſe is tedious? do they believe that that will make our life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, which gives us life? that that good will be a trouble to us, from which all goodneſs proceeds? and, in a word, that he who is the pleaſure and delight of all Creatures, of all the Seraphims, of all the Saints, and of the whole Court of Heaven, will be a tediouſneſs to us? true it is, that he ſatiates, but never becomes te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
                     <p>Nor any leſs ought a Chriſtian to be denied the Communion, to mortifie him, which is the fourth reaſon: becauſe in Mortification, to be without the Communion, he only exerciſes one Vertue, and in the Communion he exerciſes 'em all. Would it therefore be well, that a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179937:134"/>Chriſtian, for obtaining one Vertue, ſhould be deprived of all the reſt? 'Tis great pity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of the great good he receives in the Communion, only for mortification-ſake: which being well thought of, will prove rather a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good than the vertue of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, to be able to ſay Maſs and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate perfectly, it is not the beſt way to leave off communicating and celebrating: but rather 'tis the beſt that can be, to ſay Maſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate every day, though it be with ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. To inable a man to pray perfectly, or to obtain ſome vertue in perfection, 'tis not a good way to leave off doing acts of that vertue. Who will ſay, that to make a perfect Prayer, 'tis a good way to let it alone ſome days? and that to have patience, 'tis a good way not do any acts of it? rather the beſt means to obtain pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and to make a perfect Prayer, is to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thoſe things day by day, though there ſhould be ſome imperfection in 'em.</p>
                     <p>If the divine Majeſty vouchſafes to be with ſinners, to lodge in their houſes, to eat with 'em at the ſame table, (for which he bears for his arms and commands to be fixed on the doors of his houſe an Inſcription, that ſays, <hi>This Lord receives ſinners and eats at one table with 'em</hi>) why is the Miniſter and Servant of this ſame Lord ſo loath to receive a Chriſtian, if he be changed and mended by repentance? is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reaſon that the Miniſters of this Lord ſhould limit a thing not limited by their Maſter?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:179937:134"/>The Lord invites us, and calls us to his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: and will the ſervant pretend to give leave to thoſe who are invited, when they are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to God in his own houſe? Let 'em come in, if they have no mortal ſin about 'em: and if they have, 'tis waſhed away in the fountain of repentance. Put this on the account of their Lord, that will have it ſo, and commands it, though it ſeem inconvenient to the Miniſter, wherefore the Lord may anſwer him with great reaſon, <q>'Tis well known, that the ſinner coſts thee nothing, and that having ſo narrow a breaſt as thou haſt, thou admitteſt him not to the Communion, though he deſires it and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him to it: but I came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for him, and was made man, ſuffering 33 years incredible torments, even to death it ſelf. I will have him, thus penitent as he is, and becauſe I am God, I have a heart of infinite extent, where all, how wicked ſoever they may have been, do come, if they turn to me and become reform'd by means of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt our Lord moves the tongue of Angels to exhort men to frequent Communion, and the Prince of darkneſs moves the tongues of men to perſwade 'em the contrary. The Angel ſaid to <hi>Elijah,</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.7.) <hi>Ariſe and eat, for thou hast a long journey to go.</hi> So the Angel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him to the Communion; and not only once, but twice he waked the Prophet that was aſleep, to eat Bread, the figure of the Euchariſt. 'Tis the property of Angels to invite to frequent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:179937:135"/>Communion. Well did St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſay, — <hi>He is an Angel to thee who puts thee upon the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and a Devil that hinders thee from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis plain, that the Devil ſhews himſelf againſt this Sacrament more than any other, in that he ſeeks by ſo many diſturbances and ways to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, amongſt which 'tis not the leaſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual which he makes uſe of by Preachers and Confeſſors, and Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe many of 'em with a cloak of zeal diſturb it. Thoſe who reckon themſelves Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, ought to make it their proper work and buſineſs to ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devil's intentions; not depriving people of their Daily Communion, but adviſing 'em to it, and procuring it for 'em.</p>
                     <p>Fryer <hi>Joſeph</hi> of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> after he had told us the words of the holy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where he ſays— that he deſires that all men would communicate daily (in his <hi>Apology for frequent Communion</hi>) has theſe following words— Is it therefore poſſible, O my Chriſtian Fathers and Brethren, that the Church ſhould have any ſuch children who do ſo openly contradict her; and that, underſtanding from their Mother, that it would be a good thing for Chriſtians to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate every day, they ſhould ſay it is not convenient, and ſo oppoſe themſelves to her and contradict her? Certainly this looks like the Devil's temptation, to hinder the growth of Souls, though it be done with good zeal, and to ſuch as be zealous of God's honour, and of the Church their Mother, this will not look well— Thus far the Author.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:179937:135"/>Now let any Summiſt and Learned Man, that has a great opinion of himſelf, ſee whether it be lawful to oppoſe the Authority of ſo great a Tribunal and the laudable Cuſtom of the Church and her Declarations, againſt the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and againſt the Preaching of the holy Doctors of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Let no man mutter or deny the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (ſays <hi>Lewis Fundone, tract. de diu. Sacr. p.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>fol.</hi> 149.) as if there were no occaſion for it, and let him have a care that God do not deny him Heaven; ſince to condemn this, is to condemn the commendable Cuſtoms and moſt ancient Practice of the Church and the greateſt Servants of God.— Thus far the Author.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> a <hi>Benedictine,</hi> (<hi>addit. ad memor. Compoſtel. fol.</hi> 62.) ſays, <q>That as often as a man communicates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the guilt of mortal ſin, either by not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed it, or by being pardoned it, he receives grace by it. This diſpoſition is not of ſo ſmall moment, as ſome think, ſince the holy Council of <hi>Trent</hi> thinks it enough for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and holineſs. They are mightily to be commended, that do their beſt to perſwade the faithful to communicate daily; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, what a great error and prejudice of Souls are they that hinder Lay-men the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion every day.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing but Mortal Sin (ſays St. <hi>Thomas</hi>) can keep a Chriſtian from the Communion. How therefore does it come to paſs, that the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179937:136"/>Miniſters keep men from it, when they have no Mortal ſin to indiſpoſe 'em.</p>
                     <p>It would be well conſidered that Chriſt is in this Sacrament for ſalve for our wounds, for comfort to our troubles, and for ſtrength in our adverſities, and laſtly for a pledge and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the love that he bears to Souls, and that this great Lord ſtands crying out whether there be any that would have him, and the Souls an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that they will have him, but asking the Miniſters of the Church to give 'em their Lord, and divide to them their daily bread, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters turn the deaf ear to it, being Stewards of Gods houſe, and are very pinching and nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly in diſtributing that which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and ſo freely gives.</p>
                     <p>Such a ſtingineſs as this is to be lamented with Tears of Blood. Who would not weep to ſee that when Gods hand is ſo open in giving, his ſervants ſhould be ſo cloſe-fiſted and covetous in diſtributing: and that God being ſo bountiful of his own bleſſings which coſt him his blood, they ſhould be ſo greedy in a thing that coſt 'em nothing? and in a word, this Sacrament being that open fountain of <hi>David,</hi> free to all the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who go to it for the pretious water without giving any thing for it, the Miniſters ſell it ſo dear, that it coſts many even tears of blood to obtain it: which gives 'em the lamentation of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that they are fain to buy the water which is their own, as dear as if it did belong to ſome body elſe.</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>John d'Avila,</hi> a Man known ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179937:136"/>for his exemplary Goodneſs and Learning, and Preaching, being asked whether a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or one that had the cure of Souls, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Communion to him that ſhould ask it of him every day, not having lawful impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made anſwer thus, My opinion is, that no lawful impediment appearing, the Prelate (and he that in his room hath the buſineſs of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the Euchariſt) is obliged to give it to him that is under him, every time that he asks it. He that denies the moſt holy Sacrament, is unjuſt. and deprieves him of his right and due that asks it. A Chriſtian (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays) has ſo much a right to ask it, that the Prelate cannot deny it him, except it be for a publick ſin. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in publick he ought to give it him, though he knows that he has Sin in ſecret: and then how much more ought he to one that asks it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly? he is cruel, he takes away the Spiritual Bread from his Child, and I muſt condemn him for a ſinner in it. All this ſays the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Author (in his <hi>Treat.</hi> 23. <hi>Part</hi> 3.)</p>
                     <p>Will they ſay, if it be a good and holy thing to Communicate every day, why doth not the Church then command it? and why did not the Founders of Religions, who were indued with ſo much light, leave it for a rule? and why did not ſome Saints imbrace this frequency? Saint <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt cut off his Thumb, that they might not make him ordain. Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> of <hi>Aſſize</hi> would never be a Prieſt. Saint <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> was a long time without Communicating. Before I come to anſwer, I will ask whether it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:179937:137"/>be well, that a man in health ſhould not eat ſomething every day, becauſe the Law doth not command it? why have ſome Saints abſtained from food ſome days? whether ſingle life be good and not Marriage, as St <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.) becauſe the Law commands it not? and why ſome Saints have not been Married? whether it be a good and holy thing to hear Maſs daily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church does not command it? and why ſome Saints have retired into the deſert, where they could not hear it?</p>
                     <p>Again, before I come to anſwer, I will ſuppoſe that ſome examples of the Saints are more to be admired than imitated, and that therefore they do not make a general rule; that if ſome have not Communicated, they were only a few; and they that did Communicate, numberleſs: and therefore 'twill be more ſafe to follow the moſt and not the feweſt. I anſwer the difficulty and the queſtion; that things neceſſary ought to be commanded, that which is evil ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and that which is good and holy ought to be adviſed. The holy Church doth always act rightly, and therefore ſhe doth not command the faithful to Communicate daily: becauſe how holy and good a thing ſoever it be, yet 'tis not eſſentially neceſſary: and the precept of the Church always looks at the benefit of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſo great is our luke-warmneſs, and the frailty of our times, that a precept of Daily Communion would be an occaſion of ſin and ruine, and therefore the Church does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn Chriſtians by precept any more than one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179937:137"/>Communion in a year, though the deſires that through devotion men would Communicate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day.</p>
                     <p>Many men ſhift off their coming daily to this Divine Banquet, that they may not be taken notice of for it, and that they may give no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to others to grumble: and the Miniſters hearing this reaſon, hold their tongues and reſt ſatisfied. O hurtful ſilence! muſt they permit, for worldly reſpects, that the faithful ſhould loſe ſo great a benefit? Is it poſſible that they ſhould let 'em live at a diſtance, and ſeparate from God and his ſweet and loving friendſhip, becauſe the world ſhould not cenſure 'em? if there ſhould be any great account made of what the world ſays, not only the Soul would be loſt, but alſo the judgment. Is it not known, that the world makes it its buſineſs to ſpeak ill of what good is, and to perſecute thoſe that do not take part with it?</p>
                     <p>All thoſe that ſerve great men, do make open ſhew of the degree of their office, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dignity; and ſhall a Chriſtian think it a ſhame to himſelf to Communicate, and be ſeen in the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt? If it were an evil work to Communicate every day, it might breed ſcandal; but if it be the beſt work that a Chriſtian can do, why ſhould he keep from it through an idle fear of offending his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? The Jews were offended at the good works of Jeſus Chriſt, but for all that, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty never left off doing 'em. He that doth ill and interprets the good that others do in an evil
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179937:138"/>ſenſe, 'tis he that gives cauſe for the ſcandal: but to do well, was never a ſcandal, much leſs can ſo great a good, as Communicating be one. If a man ſhould take offence by ſeeing us eat, ſurely we would not for all that be ſuch fools as to ſtarve our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>We ought to take great heed of following va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and worldly pleaſures, that we may not by them offend or ſcandalize our Neighbour: from theſe vices we ought to keep our ſelves, not from Daily Communion, becauſe this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cauſe ſcandal, but will rather edifie our Neighbour, and by our good example, it may be, he may come to change his life and reſolve, himſelf, to frequent the Sacraments. O how many people are there that are cheated by theſe worldly reſpects! O unhappy men! they are not aſhamed to be baſe in their lives, and yet they are aſhamed to be Chriſtians and to be known for ſuch!</p>

He alſo deprieves him of the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his five ſenſes and powers, which he therein performs, whilſt his Eyes, his Smelling, his Taſt, his Touch, his Imagination, his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and all his knowledge and capacity do tell him that that Hoſt is Bread: by all this he is humbled, mortified, and ſubdued, whilſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that it is not that which he feels and taſts, but that his God and Lord is in it. He deprieves
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179937:139"/>him alſo, by taking the Communion from him, of the cleanſing of his ſins and evil habits, and being preſerved from 'em for the time to come; of many helps which are therein adminiſtred to him for the performance of every good thing, and avoiding every evil one; and it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that the Eternal Salvation or Damnation of a Soul may depend upon one of theſe helps. He deprieves him of the leſſening the pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, which is participated in every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. He deprieves him of the high acts of faith, hope and charity, which he exerciſes, by believing that he receives that God, whom he ſees not, nor feels, and hoping in him, whom he has not ſeen and being united with him by love.</p>
                     <p>God is goodneſs it ſelf, and he is willing to be communicated through love to Souls, by means of the Divine and Sacramental Bread: Is there a greater happineſs in the world? can there be a greater felicity? and ſhall there be any Miniſter to deprieve the Soul of this benefit? In this wonderful Sacrament Chriſt is united to the Soul, and becomes one and the ſame thing with it. <hi>In me manet &amp; ego in illo</hi> (St. <hi>John</hi> 5.) which fineneſs of love is the moſt profound, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and worthy of conſideration and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, becauſe there is no more to give nor to receive: and what Miniſter ſhall deprieve the Soul of this boundleſs grace?</p>
                     <p>All Bleſſings do here meet together in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Food, here all deſires of God are fulfilled, here is the loving and ſacramental Union, here's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179937:139"/>the Peace, the Conformity, the Transformation of God, with the Soul, and the Soul with God. By receiving Jeſus in this Sacrament, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father and the Divine Spirit is alſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: here are all the Vertues, Charity, Hope, Purity, Patience, and Humility: becauſe Chriſt our Lord begets all Vertue in the Soul, by means of this heavenly Food: and what a Heart muſt the Miniſters have to forbid the Soul ſo great a Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>If one onely degree of Grace is a gift of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable Value and ſo precious, that 'tis not to be bought for a thouſand Worlds, being a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of God himſelf, and a formal participation of the Divine Nature, which makes us his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Friends, Heirs of Heaven, and the Habitation of the moſt Holy Trinity: and if never ſo little Grace be worth more than all the Vertues, Alms, and Penances, and the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mountains (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) and giving all away to the Poor, is a meer Nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace: How then can it be well to deprive the Faithful of the increaſe of Grace, which he might find onely in one Communion? How can the Miniſter deprive him of that and of many others that follow it, without giving 'em other things equivalent to thoſe they loſe?</p>
                     <p>What can be of equal value with habitual Grace, which a faithful Man might receive? neither can the Humility which he may exerciſe, nor the Reverence, nor the Mortification, upon the account of which he leaves off the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, be worth ſo much; nor are they equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179937:140"/>to that Grace onely, which he loſes, and which he might have had by receiving that Communion.</p>
                     <p>And now lets make up this Account. If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ought to be (as all the Doctors ſay) conformable to the Good, which was taken from one's Neighbour, what can he reſtore, which deprives a faithful Man of God himſelf?</p>
                     <p>Would it not be great want of Charity to take from a Man a Mount of Gold, onely to gather up a little Grain? Onely for one Grain of Mortification, (if yet there is any in it) the Miniſters do deprive a Chriſtian of a whole Mount of Bleſſings, which are heaped up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Communion: If there were no other way to mortifie and try the Soul, but this, it ought not to be uſed; becauſe by this Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they deprive him of a greater good: but there are infinite ways of proving and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul beſides, without doing it ſo great a Spiritual Prejudice.</p>
                     <p>The Bleſſings of this Sacrament don't end here; becauſe, beſides, the increaſe of Grace, it ſuſtains and gives new ſtrength to the Soul, to reſiſt Temptations; it ſatisfies the deſires, takes away the hunger of temporal things, unites with Chriſt and his Members, who are the Juſt and Righteous, breaks the power of Satan, gives ſtrength to ſuffer Martyrdom, pardons the Venial Sins, to which he that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates doth not ſtand affected; and keeps from Mortal Sins, by vertue of the aid which it doth contribute.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:179937:140"/>The Body of Chriſt (ſays St. <hi>Bernard, In Serm. Dom</hi>) is Medicine to the Sick, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Pilgrim, freſh Strength to the Weary, it delights the Strong, it heals the wounded, it preſerves the Health of Soul and Body. And whoever is a worthy Communicant, is made more ſtrong, to receive Contempt, more patient to ſuffer Reproof, more fit to indure Troubles, more ready for Obedience, and to return the Lord Thanks.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Leo</hi> Pope, (<hi>de praec. ſer.</hi> 14. <hi>de paſs. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>) ſays, that when a man is Communicated, Chriſt comes to honour him with his Preſence, to anoint him with his Grace, to cure him with his Mercy, to heal him with his Blood, to raiſe him by his Death, to illuminate him with his Light, to inflame him with his Love, to comfort him with his infinite Sweetneſs, to be united and eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his Soul, to make him partaker of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, and of all the Bleſſings which he purchas'd us by his Croſs.</p>
                     <p>Doſt thou ſeek (ſays St. <hi>Bonaventure, de praec.</hi>) where God is? thou muſt expect to find him in this Divine Sacrament, which being worthily received, do's pardon Sins, mitigate Paſſions, gives light to the Underſtanding, ſatiates the Soul, revives Faith, encourages Hope, inkindles Charity, increaſes Devotion, fills with Grace, and is the rick Pledge of Glory.</p>
                     <p>This Sacrament (ſays St. <hi>Thomas. Opuſc.</hi> 58. <hi>de Sacr. cap.</hi> 21. 22, 23.) drives away evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, defends us from Concupiſcence, waſhes off the Stains of the Heart, appeaſes Gods Anger,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179937:141"/>illuminates the Underſtanding, to know him, inflames the Will, to love him, delights the memory with Sweetneſs, confirms the whole man in Goodneſs, frees him from Puniſhment Everlaſting, multiplies the merits of good Life, and brings him to his Eternal Country. The Body of the Lord (as he purſues it, <hi>cap.</hi> 24.) produces Three principal Effects. Firſt, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys Sin. Secondly, it increaſes Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Thirdly, it comforts men's Souls; and in Chap. 25. he ſays, it ſatiates the Spirit to follow what is good; it comforts and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Soul, to ſhun what is evil, it preſerves the Life always to praiſe the Lord. As it is a Sacrifice, it remits the Sins of thoſe who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and lightens the puniſhment of thoſe who are in Purgatory, and augments the accidental Glory of thoſe who are in Heaven. Laſtly, the Body of Chriſt is called the Sacrament of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; becauſe it makes us partakers of the Spirit Divine, of the ſweet Abode of Chriſt himſelf, and the rich Transformation of God.</p>
                     <p>'Twould be an endleſs thing to relate the Bleſſings, which, according to the ſaying of Saints, they do receive from this Sacrament, who come to partake of it without Mortal Sin: and of all theſe doth the Miniſter deprive a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, when he onely forbids him one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>But more than this, deprieving 'em of the Communion, he deprieves all the Saints of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all the Angels, the moſt holy Virgin, and Chriſt himſelf of that accidental glory which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179937:141"/>accrues to them by every Communion received in grace. If the Saints in Heaven have a ſpecial accidental glory, by every good work, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſmall, that is done here below, as many pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Authors are of opinion, with how much more reaſon will they have it by a work ſo ſublime as the Communion is, wherein there is included an immenſity of all the wonderful works of God? <hi>Memoriam fecit mirabilium ſuorum, Pſal.</hi> 110.</p>
                     <p>And if from one onely Communion there are ſo many bleſſings, as are ſpecified before, to be obtained, what will there be of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, the graveſt, the higheſt work that is in Heaven or Earth? And ſhall there then be Miniſters, who under pretence of Penance, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, or the old way, muſt hinder Prieſts ſo great, ſo holy, and ſo fruitful a ſacrifice?</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaid, <hi>in</hi> (<hi>Miſſis defunct. Pavi. c.</hi> 14) that at the leaſt the Soul ſuffers not in Purgatory, whilſt Maſs is ſaid for it ['twas well the Author did not point to us where this blind paſſage is, in Saint <hi>Jeromes</hi> Works.] Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſures us, (<hi>Balleſter</hi> in the Book of the Crucifix of S. Saviour, f. 207.) that the Divine Sacrifice is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Celebrated, but one of theſe two things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it, either the Converſion of a ſinner, or the leting looſe of ſome Soul out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, [this is as much Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſaying, as t'other is Saint <hi>Jeromes.</hi>] <hi>William Altiſiodoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> was not contented with one Soul; but affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that by every Maſs there were the Lord knows how many Souls that got away from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179937:142"/>thence. <hi>Severus</hi> in Saint <hi>Martins</hi> Life gives an account, that he ſet as many Souls at liberty with his Maſſes, as perſons aſſiſted at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 'em.</p>
                     <p>Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> ſays, that the Prieſt, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not lawfully hindred, doth neglect to ſay Maſs, deprieves the moſt holy Trinity of glory and praiſe, the Angels of joy, Sinners of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the Righteous of grace and help, the Souls in Purgatory of cooling and refreſhment, the Church of the heavenly benefit of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and the Prieſt himſelf of Medicine and help.</p>
                     <p>If every Maſs therefore has all this of its own, what Miniſter under the colour of zeal ſhall be ſo bold as to hinder and defraud the Trinity, the Angels, the Virgin, the Church, the Righteous, Sinners, the Souls in Purgatory, and the Prieſts themſelves that deſire to celebrate, ſo much glory and ſo much good? without doubt, though this be done with zeal, yet 'tis want of conſideration, and it will be well, to premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and conſider it better, before any goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to hinder it.</p>
